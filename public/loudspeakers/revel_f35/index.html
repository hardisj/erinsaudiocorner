<p>All data collected using <a href="http://www.klippel.de/products/rd-system/modules/nfs-near-field-scanner.html#:~:text=The%20Near%2DField%20Scanner%203D,move%20during%20the%20scanning%20process.">Klippel&rsquo;s Near-Field Scanner</a>.  The Near-Field-Scanner 3D (NFS) offers a fully automated acoustic measurement of direct sound radiated from the source under test. The radiated sound is determined in any desired distance and angle in the 3D space outside the scanning surface. Directivity, sound power, SPL response and many more key figures are obtained for any kind of loudspeaker and audio system in near field applications (e.g. studio monitors, mobile devices) as well as far field applications (e.g. professional audio systems). Utilizing a minimum of measurement points, a comprehensive data set is generated containing the loudspeaker&rsquo;s high resolution, free field sound radiation in the near and far field.  For a detailed explanation of how the NFS works and the science behind it, please watch the below discussion with designer Christian Bellmann:</p>

CTA-2034 / SPINORAMA:
</summary>
</br>
<p>
The On-axis Frequency Response (0°) is the universal starting point and in many situations it is a fair representation of the first sound to arrive at a listener’s ears.
<p>The Listening Window is a spatial average of the nine amplitude responses in the ±10º vertical and ±30º horizontal angular range. This encompasses those listeners who sit within a typical home theater audience, as well as those who disregard the normal rules when listening alone.</p>
<p>The Early Reflections curve is an estimate of all single-bounce, first-reflections, in a typical listening room.</p>
<p>Sound Power represents all of the sounds arriving at the listening position after any number of reflections from any direction. It is the weighted rms average of all 70 measurements, with individual measurements weighted according to the portion of the spherical surface that they represent.</p>
<p>Sound Power Directivity Index (SPDI): In this standard the SPDI is defined as the difference between the listening window curve and the sound power curve.</p>
<p>Early Reflections Directivity Index (EPDI): is defined as the difference between the listening window curve and the early reflections curve. In small rooms, early reflections figure prominently in what is measured and heard in the room so this curve may provide insights into potential sound quality.</p>

Estimated In-Room Response:
</summary></br>
<p>
In theory, with complete 360-degree anechoic data on a loudspeaker and sufficient acoustical and geometrical data on the listening room and its layout it would be possible to estimate with good precision what would be measured by an omnidirectional microphone located in the listening area of that room. By making some simplifying assumptions about the listening space, the data set described above permits a usefully accurate preview of how a given loudspeaker might perform in a typical domestic listening room. Obviously, there are no guarantees, because individual rooms can be acoustically aberrant. Sometimes rooms are excessively reflective (“live”) as happens in certain hot, humid climates, with certain styles of interior décor and in under-furnished rooms. Sometimes rooms are excessively “dead” as in other styles of décor and in some custom home theaters where acoustical treatment has been used excessively. This form of post processing is offered only as an estimate of what might happen in a domestic living space with carpet on the floor and a “normal” amount of seating, drapes and cabinetry.
<p>For these limited circumstances it has been found that a usefully accurate Predicted In-Room (PIR) amplitude response, also known as a “room curve” is obtained by a weighted average consisting of 12 % listening window, 44 % early reflections and 44 % sound power. At very high frequencies errors can creep in because of excessive absorption, microphone directivity, and room geometry. These discrepancies are not considered to be of great importance.</p>

<h3 id="dynamic-range-instantaneous-compression-test">Dynamic Range (Instantaneous Compression Test)</h3>
<p>The below graphic indicates just how much SPL is lost (compression) or gained (enhancement; usually due to distortion) when the speaker is played at higher output volumes <em>instantly</em> via a 2.7 second logarithmic sine sweep <em>referenced to 76dB at 1 meter</em>.  The signals are played consecutively <em>without</em> any additional stimulus applied.  Then normalized against the 76dB result.</p>
<p>The tests are conducted in this fashion:</p>
<ol>
<li>76dB at 1 meter (baseline; black)</li>
<li>86dB at 1 meter (red)</li>
<li>96dB at 1 meter (blue)</li>
<li>102dB at 1 meter (purple)</li>
</ol>
<p>The purpose of this test is to illustrate how much (if at all) the output changes as a speaker&rsquo;s components temperature increases (i.e., voice coils, crossover components) instantaneously.</p>
<p><img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/qtelkz4oiq66bd00n8sm2/Revel-F35_Compression.png?rlkey=7v2gs2mo86i35gijm2kt5fco9&st=4vzm2tr4&dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" /></p>

<h3 id="multitone-distortion">Multitone Distortion</h3>
<p>The following tests are conducted at (4) approximate equivalent output volumes: 70/79/87/96dB @ 1 meter.  The (4) voltages listed in the legend result in these SPL values.  This test signal is dense, similar to pink noise and excites the entire spectrums listed below at the same time.  The test signal lasts 30 seconds.  This is different than the sine wave test signal used to measure frequency response.  The purpose of <em>this</em> distortion and compression test is to illustrate how much (if at all) the output changes as a speaker&rsquo;s components temperature increases (i.e., voice coils, crossover components) over time.</p>
<p>Given the test signal is similar to pink noise and exciting the entire spectrum at the same time I also include compression results, which is captured at the same time distortion is captured.  Sometimes these results differ from the compression results you see above (namely with powered designs incorporating DSP-based limiting).</p>
<p>Note: The KLIPPEL software shows compression in the positive scale.</p>
<p>The test was conducted in (3) manners:</p>
<ol>
<li>Full bandwidth (20Hz to 20kHz)</li>
<li>80Hz to 20kHz</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason for the two measurements is to simulate running the speaker full range vs using a high-pass filter at 80Hz. However, note: the 2nd test low frequency limit at 80Hz is a “brick wall” and doesn&rsquo;t quite emulate a standard filter of 12 or 24dB/octave. But… it’s close enough to illustrate the point.</p>

<h2 id="parting--random-thoughts">Parting / Random Thoughts</h2>
<p>See video linked above for full subjective and objective analysis. An AI-generated summarized transcript is provided below:</p>
<br>
<p><u>Listening Notes:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>For the most part, these are pretty benign speakers. Nothing that stands out as glaringly problematic. I heard some things that didn&rsquo;t sound quite &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; but only one was annoying, and that was the sibilance. Luckily, this can be EQ&rsquo;d down if you find it annoying.</li>
<li>There is also an apparent loss of &ldquo;attack&rdquo; and a &ldquo;recess&rdquo; to the vocals thanks to the ~2-3kHz dip. Female vocals sounded a bit boosted to me by mildly. The data doesn&rsquo;t indicate an issue here in the frequency response but there is a resonance that shows in the impedance ~275Hz &hellip; maybe that&rsquo;s what I was hearing?</li>
<li>In my listening room, I felt like these didn&rsquo;t quite have the &ldquo;umph&rdquo; in the kickbass that I like, and I couldn&rsquo;t determine if it was low bass (40- 60Hz) or midbass (100- 120Hz). Well, the data shows a bit of a bump just below 100Hz and a rolloff around 60Hz. My best guess is that this bump below 100Hz is what made it sound like the extra layer of &ldquo;thump&rdquo; was missing in the 100- 120Hz because this is down about 1.5dB relative to 90Hz.</li>
<li>I liked the wide soundstage I was hearing from these and the data shows a horizontal profile of about ±70° but with some flaring ~3kHz. I think side panel absorption could help this speaker not sound as recessed in the upper midrange and may even help lessen the sibilance.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<p><u>Data:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Aside from the things I related to the listening tests above, here are some quick thoughts:</li>
<li>Sensitivity is quite high at 89.4dB (though, not pro-audio sensitivity levels).</li>
<li>Bass extension is reasonably good but with an F3/F10 of 61/39Hz, you&rsquo;ll want a subwoofer if you want low bass, especially for movies.</li>
<li>Distortion is low. Not just in the midrange but in the midbass region as well.</li>
<li>Compression is good, too.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<p><u>Summary:</u></p>
<p>Overall, I think this is a good speaker with a couple of issues that can be fixed via EQ or by adding a subwoofer. They&rsquo;d do great for a budget-friendly stereo or home theater system.</p>
<p>For the current price of $450/each, I don&rsquo;t think these can be beat in the floorstanding speaker category. You get good bass extension, overall relatively neutral sound, and high sensitivity. At their previous MSRP of $880/each, I&rsquo;d have more suggestions to look at.</p>
<p>The ELAC DF63 is a fine alternative, but now retails for $650/each.

<p>I do not take adspace nor do manufacturers pay me for reviews. All revenue is through YouTube ad-revenue or directly from contributions from viewers such as yourself. While this is not my full-time job it&rsquo;s cool when I&rsquo;m able to make a few bucks for my efforts.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to support the channel I have listed a few ways below. Thank you!</p>
