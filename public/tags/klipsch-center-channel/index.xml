      <title>Klipsch Forte IV Review</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/loudspeakers/klipsch_forte_iv/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/loudspeakers/klipsch_forte_iv/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword--youtube-video-review&#34;&gt;Foreword / YouTube Video Review&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note:  These speakers were loaned to me by a viewer in brand new in box condition.  Multi-tone stimulus was played through these speakers for about 3 days&amp;rsquo; time before listening/testing (not that I personally think it is needed but to calm anyone&amp;rsquo;s concerns about &amp;ldquo;break in&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Klipsch Heresy IV Review (Redux!)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/loudspeakers/klipsch_heresy_iv/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword--youtube-video-review&#34;&gt;Foreword / YouTube Video Review&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note 1:  I reviewed this speaker approximately a year ago using quasi-anechoic methods.  I am re-reviewing the speaker with Klippel&amp;rsquo;s Near Field Scanner and have removed my old review as to not cause any confusion between the new and &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; dataset.  However, the old data was within acceptable error and would be suitable to use if not for the new data&amp;rsquo;s higher resolution and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
