      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword--youtube-video-review&#34;&gt;Foreword / YouTube Video Review&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These speakers were loaned to me by their owner.  This specific model - the Model 2c - was produced from 1980-1989 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vandersteen.com/what-vintage&#34;&gt;according to the manufacturer&lt;/a&gt;. They are certainly used but appear to be in good working condition and the data I am providing here does follow design characteristics of data published for other Vandersteen &amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo; Models.  There are no signs of abuse.  Through the grille cloth I can see the drivers and there are no signs of surround rot or exposure to the elements.  Rather, what I see is just expected wear from a speaker that is over 30 years old at this point.  Therefore, I feel confident that the speaker is a properly functioning sample.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
