## Foreword / YouTube Video Review
The review on this website is a brief overview and summary of the objective performance of this speaker.  It is not intended to be a deep dive.  More so, this is information for those who prefer "just the facts" and prefer to have the data without the filler.

However, for those who want more - a more detailed explanation of the objective performance, and my subjective evaluation (what I heard, what I liked, etc) - please watch the below video where I go more in-depth.  Additionally, my CEA-2010 test results can be viewed directly via my Google Sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18bz7z-xIlRJsC-bw6k4mHkuwv_uiGAMyEhgrTkjwdXc/edit?usp=sharing).

## Information and Photos

<br>

Both the [SVS SB-2000 Pro](https://www.svsound.com/products/sb-2000-pro?variant=31456365969517) and [SB-3000](https://www.svsound.com/products/sb-3000?variant=13625168461933) subwoofers are relatively compact subwoofers with serious output.

The SB-2000 Pro features a 12-inch driver with 550 Watts RMS, 1,500+ Watts peak power Sledge amplifier with fully discrete MOSFET output, and SVS subwoofer DSP smartphone app in a compact cabinet measuring roughly 15-inches on all sides.

The SB-3000 features an all-new first ever 13-inch high-excursion SVS driver and 800 watts RMS, 2,500+ watts peak power Sledge amplifier with fully discrete MOSFET output. Its deep and thunderous low frequency output with revealing clarity and flawless tonal accuracy delights hardcore audiophiles and home theater fans alike. Measuring just over 15-inches cubed, the SB-3000 outperforms much larger subwoofers and takes command of a room sonically without taking over visually.

They both feature SVS' built-in DSP with Bluetooth integration.  This feature allows you to use an app from your phone - from the comfort of your seated position - to control volume, adjust settings such as high-pass filter, phase, 3-bands of Parametric EQ and other features.  I really, really love this feature and it is, in my humble opinion, something that sets the SVS line apart from other subwoofers.

Another "feature" about SVS is their longstanding customer service marks, 5-year warranty and 45-day return "risk-free in-home trial".

The price for each varies depending on finish.  I tested the gloss white SB-2000 Pro and the gloss black SB-3000.  I have listed the prices (as of this review) below:
* SB-2000 Pro: $799 (black ash), $899 (gloss)
* SB-3000: $999 (black ash), $1099 (gloss)

## Frequency Response

The below frequency responses were taken with all DSP options disabled, volume at maximum and 0.05v RMS input in to the LFE channel.  You can see the SB-2000 Pro has a more linear frequency response while the SB-3000 has a rise in the higher-frequency response until approximately 160Hz where both subwoofers begin to trail off.

## Group Delay

<br>

## "Room Gain Compensation"
The below provides an idea of how the integrated DSP's "room gain compensation" feature works.  As you can see, depending on the chosen frequency, the low-frequency response is rolled off earlier than the subwoofer naturally rolls off.  This might be ideal for those who have a very small room and get exaggerated bass or have neighbors who they do not want to bother with very low frequency effects.

## CEA-2010 Test Results

CEA-2010-A vs CEA-2010-B Foreword:

CEA-2010-A and CEA-2010-B are completely different tests with different distortion thresholds and therefore should only be compared to other like tests (A vs A, B vs B).  To date, I am the only independent outlet providing -B tests so no worries there.  Comparisons between my own -A and -B tests should only be made for educational purposes.

-A specification uses only frequencies from 20Hz to 63H in 1/3-Octave steps (20/25/31.5/40 Hz).  Distortion thresholds are the same for each frequency.  Other outlets have taken the liberty to use those same thresholds and apply them to frequencies above/below the -A standard.  To provide a comparison, I have also done the same.  However, note these frequencies below 20Hz and above 63Hz are not part of the CEA-2010-A specification.

-B specification uses frequencies 12.5/16/20/25/31.5/40/60/80/100/120/160 Hz with varying distortion thresholds per frequency.  More can be read about this in the CTA-2010-B specification.  Peak values are obtained, then weighted per the spec.  Maximum SPL values are provided for each frequency.  A final "broadband" Peak SPL value is provided based on each frequency's max SPL.  While I have chosen to provide "extended" frequency results for -A (those tones above and below the specification's called out frequencies), I am not doing so for -B because there is no reasonable way to determine what the threshold for those values should be.  I believe those who wrote the spec to be smarter than me and I do not take liberties in adjusting specifications at will.  You can download a copy of the -B specification [here](https://shop.cta.tech/products/standard-method-of-measurement-for-subwoofers).  The CEA-2010-A standard is not free and thus I have no freely available link.

All the following data is from my spreadsheet which can viewed directly [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18bz7z-xIlRJsC-bw6k4mHkuwv_uiGAMyEhgrTkjwdXc/edit?usp=sharing).

<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1low0mtjak1zb01/Maximum%20SPL%20%28dB%29%20per%20CEA-2010-A%20%282-meter%20Ground%20Plane%29.png?dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />

<br>

In both test standards the SB-3000 provides more output.  Per the CEA-2010-A spec, Above 31.5Hz the difference is approximately 5dB higher with the SB-3000.  Below this, there is approximately 3dB difference.  Per the CEA-2010-B spec, the difference follows the same trends.  Both subwoofers display a lot of clean output potential.

## Parting / Random Thoughts

I encourage you to watch my YouTube review for more details but a quick few notes:
* At only $200 more, the SB-3000 represents the better value, in my humble opinion.  It isn't much larger than the SB-2000 Pro and it has considerably more output capability.  However, the SB-3000 might be overkill for most.  My living room (which is where I demoed these subwoofers) is about 20x20 feet but is open to the kitchen, the dining room and the hallway.  So, effectively, my living room is considerably larger than the dimensions indicate.  Still, I found the SB-2000 Pro to be ample for music listening in my room, as there is a room mode that boosts the response about 6dB at 30Hz.  For movies with LFE below 25Hz, though, the SB-3000 proved more useful.  So, it really is up to you as to what makes the most sense.  If you do want very LFE and/or you don't have the benefit of room gain (large room or bad placement), then the SB-3000 is the better option.  If you have a smaller room and/or you don't need very low frequency output then the SB-2000 Pro will be just fine.  And, remember, 2 subs are always better than one. So, it might even make more sense to purchase two of the SB-2000 Pro (if it is within your budget).
* Listening to these in my living room, they paired great with a variety of speakers.  From the Kef R3 to the JBL HDI-3800.
* With the variety of DSP features in these subwoofers, there really is no reason why someone could not get a very nice response in their listening position.  I highly recommend you taking the time to download [Room EQ Wizard](https://www.roomeqwizard.com/) and using the [MiniDSP UMIK-1](https://www.minidsp.com/products/acoustic-measurement/umik-1) (or UMIK-2) in order to help you match the subwoofer(s) to the main speakers.
* The built-in Bluetooth of these subwoofers in conjunction with the BT app (for iPhone and Android) makes it incredibly easy to dial in the sound to your liking.  Even from the comfort of your couch.  Which means no getting up from your seat and going back and forth between the amp and your seat to get the sound just right.  This is a feature that is incredibly useful.  That said, some users may prefer to use a room correction program such as Dirac Live which then diminishes the need for the built-in DSP of the SVS subwoofers.
* There was no audible mechanical resonance and no indication of this in the data.
* I was quite impressed with both subwoofers and would recommend them to anyone in the market for a subwoofer with plenty of output down to 30Hz.  And with room gain, these should be able to satisfy most listener's needs.  If you need ultrasonic output, though, then you may want to consider a larger woofer and/or ported design.


As stated in the Foreword, this written review is purposely a cliff's notes version.  For more details about the performance (objectively and subjectively) please watch the YouTube video.
