## Foreword / YouTube Video Review
The review on this website is a brief overview and summary of the objective performance of this speaker.  It is not intended to be a deep dive.  More so, this is information for those who prefer "just the facts" and prefer to have the data without the filler.

However, for those who want more - a more detailed explanation of the objective performance, and my subjective evaluation (what I heard, what I liked, etc) - please watch the below video where I go more in-depth.  Additionally, my CEA-2010 test results can be viewed directly via my Google Sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18bz7z-xIlRJsC-bw6k4mHkuwv_uiGAMyEhgrTkjwdXc/edit?usp=sharing).

This subwoofer was also reviewed by James Larson at Audioholics ([link](https://www.audioholics.com/subwoofer-reviews/rsl-speedwoofer-12s-1)) who provided a much more thorough written analysis of his subjective thoughts than I do in this writeup.

## Test Setup/Conditions:

All measurements - other than CEA-2010 - are provided as full-space anechoic @ 1 meter.  This means frequency response, distortion and group delay were taken outdoors with the SPL referenced to a distance of 1 meter.

<br>

## Frequency Response

The below shows the response in (4) different modes:
* Reference
* Movie
* Music
* Boundary

Reference provides the most linear response.  Movie has a +2dB bump centered ~30Hz for enhanced bass effects. Music has a +1dB bump from about 30Hz to 60hz, centered around 45Hz to provide a bit more "punch".  Boundary mode decreases the output below ~40Hz due to the fact that placement near a wall will provide additional gain here.

## Max SPL / Compression

The following test was ran at 3 input voltages:
* 0.01 Volt RMS
* 0.10 Volt RMS
* 2.50 Volt RMS

The frequency response of each is provided below for comparison and understanding of the built-in limiting function that typically attenuates low frequency with higher SPL.  In this case, compared to the blue line at 84dB, the max SPL is boosted ~1.5dB from 30Hz to 60Hz and attenuated approximately 3dB below 30Hz.  In other words, there is approximately 3dB of compression between 84dB and 100dB average SPL (blue vs red).

## Parting / Random Thoughts

<br>

This subwoofer is likely the best deal going today.  The output capability, DSP features and overall performance are all at the top of the pack.  Though, this subwoofer is rather large and heavy so consider that when comparing to other 12-inch subwoofers. You get significant more output capability with this compared to many of the "budget" $200-400 12-inch subwoofers available via Amazon but this subwoofer is quite a bit larger than many of them.
