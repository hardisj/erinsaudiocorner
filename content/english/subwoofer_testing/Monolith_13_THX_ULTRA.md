## Foreword / YouTube Video Review
The review on this website is a brief overview and summary of the objective performance of this speaker.  It is not intended to be a deep dive.  More so, this is information for those who prefer "just the facts" and prefer to have the data without the filler.

However, for those who want more - a more detailed explanation of the objective performance, and my subjective evaluation (what I heard, what I liked, etc) - please watch the below video where I go more in-depth.  Additionally, my CEA-2010 test results can be viewed directly via my Google Sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18bz7z-xIlRJsC-bw6k4mHkuwv_uiGAMyEhgrTkjwdXc/edit?usp=sharing).

## Test Setup/Conditions:

For test setup and conditions please view my discussion on [this page](https://www.erinsaudiocorner.com/subwoofer_testing/cea-2010_subwoofer_testing/).

<br>

## Frequency Response

The below shows the response in (4) different modes:
* THX Mode Enabled & Ported
* THX Mode Enabled & Sealed
* Extended Mode Enabled & Ported
* Extended Mode Enabled & Sealed

As you can see, the "Extended" mode generally adds a small bit more SPL at the lower frequencies but does so at the cost of linearity; exhibiting somewhat of a droop compared to that of the "THX" mode.  Ported does extend the response while sealed limits the low frequency response, though, does not show the port resonance in the 200Hz region that the ported options do.  However, this resonance is likely to not be a factor given it is so relatively high in frequency.

### Nonlinearities

Traditionally, Xmax has been defined in one of the following ways:
- the physical overhang of the voice coil (height of the voice coil relative to height of the gap)
- 115% times the physical overhang above
- the point where displacement limit(s) is/are exceeded

The third option is where the Klippel LSI module comes in to play. It permits a more "apples to apples" approach of defining the displacement (Xmax) limits based on the XBL, XC, XL and Xd.  The displacement limits XBL, XC, XL and Xd describe the limiting effect for the force factor Bl(x), compliance Cms(x), inductance Le(x) and Doppler effect, respectively, according to the threshold values Blmin, Cmin, Zmax and d2 used by the operator.

</br>

There are one of two sets of thresholds which can be used to define linear excursion:
1) Non-Subwoofer Drivers: The thresholds Blmin= 82 %, Cmin=75 %, Zmax=10 % and d2=10% generate for a two-tone-signal (f1=fs, f2=8.5fs) 10 % total harmonic distortion and 10 % intermodulation distortion.
2) Subwoofer Drivers: The thresholds Blmin= 70 %, Cmin=50 %, Zmax=17 % create 20 % total harmonic distortion which is becoming the standard for acceptable subwoofer distortion thresholds.

</br>

These parameters are defined in more detail in the (Klippel) papers:
* “AN04 – Measurement of Peak Displacement Xmax”
* “AN05 - Displacement Limits due to Driver Nonlinearities”
* “AN17 - Credibility of Nonlinear Parameters”
* “Prediction of Speaker Performance at High Amplitudes”
* “Assessment of Voice Coil Peak Displacement Xmax”
* “Assessing Large Signal Performance of Loudspeakers”

</br></br>

Below are the displacement limits' results for this drive unit obtained from Klippel's LSI module using the 20% THD threshold:

| Displacement Limits   |             |         |                                                                   |
|-----------------------|-------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| X Bl @ Bl min=70%     | >32.6        | mm      | Displacement limit due to force factor variation                  |
| X C @ C min=50%       | >32.6         | mm      | Displacement limit due to compliance variation                    |
| X L @ Z max=17%      | >32.6         | mm      | Displacement limit due to inductance variation                    |
| X d @ d2=20%          | 162.3        | mm      | Displacement limit due to IM distortion (Doppler)                 |

As you can see, I was not able to test the speaker to full resolution of its limits, ultimately winding up with the LSI module showing me that this subwoofer driver has *at least* 21mm one-way linear excursion.  This is quite a feat and one of the longest throw woofers I have seen data for and the longest linear excursion I have personally tested to date.

I typically share the Bl/Kms/Le(x) curves that come from the Klippel LSI module for drivers but since this speaker's excursion was not fully resolved, it does mean there is the high probability that the results I share here might not be complete and therefore incorrect (the closer to the actual resolution of an xmax figure, the more accurate the curve for each component is).  Rather than post incomplete/incorrect curves I have decided to just provide the values above as an indication of the performance of this drive unit.

## Parting / Random Thoughts

<br>

This subwoofer is a beast.  A costly beast.  But, a beast nonetheless.

As you can see, the 13-inch subwoofer actually has a bit more SPL at the lowest frequencies but above 20Hz, the 15-inch version has considerably more output.  Generally, I recommend subwoofers that behave more linearly throughout and the additional output of the 13-inch version yields a more overall linear response.

The frequency response is quite good and this subwoofer will fill a large room with plenty of bass (though, more than one subwoofer is always recommended to even out the in-room bass).  The only real issue I have with this sub is nothing to do with its performance; it's heavy.  I'm not a bodybuilder but I am not a string bean, either, and lugging this thing around was a pain.  If you need to carry this upstairs just make sure to have some help or a really good stair-friendly dolly.

As stated in the Foreword, this written review is purposely a cliff's notes version.  For more details about the performance (objectively and subjectively) please watch the YouTube video.
