## Test Setup Information:

Testing was conducted using the [Quant Asylum QA402](https://quantasylum.com/products/qa403-audio-analyzer).
* Warmup: Unit was provided pink noise with an output of 1 watt into a 4-ohm load for 10 minutes.
* Test Bandwidth: 22.4kHz (48 kHz Sample Rate) (unless otherwise stated)
* Input to DUT: Phono (RCA).
* Output from DUT: Phono (RCA).
* Volume/Gain: Max.
* DSP Settings: None Unless Otherwise Specified.
* Tests were run at 4 and 8-ohm loads.  Both channels loaded.  However, due to server space costs, results published here are based upon the 4-ohm testing (unless otherwise noted).
* Beyond the static loads mentioned above, *Reactive Loads* were also used for testing and noted.  Both a "simple" and "complex" load. These are designed to emulate a true speaker load without risking damaging a real speaker or deafening myself to test tones from a real speaker.  The impedance sweep of these loads are provided below.

<br>


## Reactive Loads Impedance

## Frequency Response

Response shows practically zero load dependency of the speaker outputs.

<br>

Subwoofer Crossover (200Hz shown). This crossover enables both a LPF on the subwoofer pre-out and a HPF for the speaker outputs.

## THD vs Power (1kHz)

The below graphic shows the THD as output level increases from left to right on the X-axis.  I am showing only one channel here - which is the worst channel - for each load. This test is conducted wtih a 1kHz tone (as is standard).

Per the graphic below, max power at 0.10% THD is approximately:
* 125wpc @ 8 ohms
* 175wpc @ 4 ohms
* Subwoofer pre-out voltage is ~ 4.92 Vrms at max unclipped volume.

## THD vs Frequency

The below graphic shows the THD as frequency increases from left to right on the X-axis.  I am showing only one channel here - which is the worst channel - for each load. The highest drive level in this test corresponds to the manufacturer's rated power.

## Power Degradation

The below section pertains to power capability at low volume vs high volume when two test signals are used: a) 1kHz tone and b) Multitone signal.  I have provided 4 ohm only but 8 ohm shows similar results.

In an ideal world the power for the multitone signal is the same as the single 1kHz. Let's verify.

1kHz, low power:

<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/85e3i5fil1hx0g4l5jkw0/1kHz-2w-4R.png?rlkey=wz4xig1hfxm6djvpvflpj20ey&dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />
<br>
<br>

Multitone, low power:

<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/in2xg9szq2niel2lrzx2l/Multitone-2w-4R.png?rlkey=cv2lk7yvdncwnzpaaw9vspbhn&dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />
<br>
<br>


1kHz, rated power:

<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/g9t87am01uwsaxhy12vyv/1kHz-100w-4R.png?rlkey=8aaaqc1jqciwox152j1tzr32w&dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />
<br>
<br>

Multitone, rated power:

<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/5bq1p1mg43rkzjh246har/Multitone-100w-4R.png?rlkey=prmq7o5i2o09n453a35bzmphf&dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />
<br>
<br>


As we can see from the above, at low power the test signal used doesn't change the output.  At rated power there is approximately 3 watts of power loss with the multitone signal compared to the single 1kHz signal.

## Parting / Random Thoughts

See video linked above for subjective and objective analysis. A summarized transcript is provided below:

The NAD C 3050 Integrated Amplifier is a modern retro unit that features streaming capabilities and Dirac Live functionality (though, limited to 20-500Hz). It has a classic aesthetic and offers various inputs and outputs, including HDMI ARC, RCA preouts and a subwoofer preout. It is a class D amplifier that provides enough power for standard sensitivity speakers with a resistance down to 4 ohm. The amplifier can be controlled through the BluOS app and offers adjustable bass and treble settings. Power rating is 100x2 @ 4 and 8 ohm and my results show this to be easily met with very low distortion.
