## Information and Photos

Some specs from the manufacturer are below and full specs can be found [here](https://fosiaudio.com/products/fosi-audio-za3-balanced-dual-mode-class-d-amplifier).
* Dual-Mode Innovation: This new generation mini amplifier offers both stereo and mono modes, adapts flexibly to your diverse needs, allowing seamless mode switching. In stereo mode, it delivers a robust output of up to 180W, while in mono mode, the power soars to a maximum of 235W. Pair two ZA3 units in mono configuration to create a powerful audio system, significantly enhancing your listening experience.
* Richer Connectivity: Debut amplifier with balanced input and trigger in, the ZA3 features a balanced combo audio signal input connector supporting both XLR and 1/4" TRS plugs. This design minimizes interference and reduces noise floor. The 12V trigger-in connector enables synchronization with other devices, streamlining the process of turning on/off without individual operations.
* Audiophile-Grade Components: The ZA3 features the TPA3255 high-end Class-D amp chip and utilizes premium Japanese NCC, ELNA, and German WIMA capacitors, and Japanese Sumida inductors for exceptional audio quality. With a SINAD rating of up to 89dB, an SNR of up to 106dB, and a low noise floor of only 150Î¼V, it delivers exceptional clarity and low distortion.
* Advanced Heat Dissipation: Based on V3's groundbreaking heat dissipation design, we upgraded ZA3's cooling system by featuring a larger chassis, moving vents to the sides, and adding dust covers to achieve better ventilation for a sustained and stable high power output.
* Enhanced Scalable Fun: Personalize your audio experience with the op-amp rolling feature! The ZA3 stocks five swappable op-amps for left and right channel outputs, balanced input, and subwoofer output. Experiment with compatible DIP8 dual op-amps such as Sparkos SS3602, MUSES02, OPA2604, OPA2134PA, OP249, AD827, RM4558, LM4562, LME49720HA, etc. to fine-tune your sound to perfection.

## Test Setup Information:

Testing was conducted using the [Quant Asylum QA402](https://quantasylum.com/products/qa403-audio-analyzer).
* Warmup: Unit was provided pink noise with an output of 1 watt into a 4-ohm load for 10 minutes.
* Test Bandwidth: 22.4kHz (48 kHz Sample Rate) (unless otherwise stated).
* FFT Size: 64k (unless otherwise stated).
* Input to DUT: Phono (RCA).
* Output from DUT: Phono (RCA).
* Volume/Gain: Max.
* DSP Settings: None Unless Otherwise Specified.
* Tests were run at 4 and 8-ohm loads.  Both channels loaded.  However, due to server space costs, results published here are based upon the 4-ohm testing (unless otherwise noted).
* Beyond the static loads mentioned above, *Reactive Loads* were also used for testing and noted.  Both a "simple" and "complex" load. These are designed to emulate a true speaker load without risking damaging a real speaker or deafening myself to test tones from a real speaker.  The impedance sweep of these loads are provided below.

## Reactive Loads Impedance

## Frequency Response

Response shows some load dependency of the speaker outputs.

<br>

## Subwoofer Channel Output

Note that speaker output is full-range when subwoofer is connected.

<br>

## THD vs Power (1kHz)

The below graphic shows the THD as output level increases from left to right on the X-axis.  I am showing only one channel here - which is the worst channel - for each load. This test is conducted wtih a 1kHz tone (as is standard).

Note that 4 ohm results are quite a bit short of the manufacturer specification when both channels are driven as you see below.

<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/zfl8z5ztjzu1gligj2d62/Power-vs-THD-64k-FFT.png?rlkey=bo9fm9vmliaqw66uj2ow5nhxe&dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />
<br>
<br>

After investigation I found that stimulus length has a pretty big influence on the test above.  Below is the same test as above but using an FFT length of 8k which is a faster pulse and results in a higher power output rating at 4 ohm than the above.

## THD vs Frequency

The below graphic shows the THD as frequency increases from left to right on the X-axis.  I am showing only one channel here - which is the worst channel - for each load. The highest drive level in this test corresponds to the manufacturer's rated power.

<br>


## Power Degradation

The below section pertains to power capability at low volume vs high volume when two test signals are used: a) 1kHz tone and b) Multitone signal.

I typically provide 4 ohm results but in this case, as you can see in the THD vs Power results above, when this amp is driving (2) 4 ohm loads for longer than a flash of an instant the amplifier goes into protect.  Therefore, I cannot provide the "at rated power" result for this 1kHz vs Multitone test at 4 ohm.

## Parting / Random Thoughts

See video linked above for subjective and objective analysis. A summarized transcript is provided below:

While my testing resulted in a pretty significant "fail" for 4-ohm stereo testing, the use of this amplifier for different speakers didn't result in the amplifier going into protect.  Still, I am quite disappointed in the objective results of this 4 ohm test.

My other complaint is that the main speaker outputs are not high-passed when the subwoofer output is engaged.  You therefore have both your mains and your subwoofer playing below ~120Hz (-3dB point of the subwoofer LPF).

For $150 I'm kind of "meh" on the objective performance.  It's a case of "might be fine", and it was for my in-room use but the results of my testing and the subwoofer/mains not being properly filtered as a combo are disappointing.
