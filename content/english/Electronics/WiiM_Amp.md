I offer this for free to all who are interested.  In return, if you want to support this site please see the bottom of this review for ways you can help.  It is greatly appreciated.

The review on this website is a brief overview and summary of the objective performance of this processor.  It is not intended to be a deep dive.  Moreso, this is information for those who prefer "just the facts" and prefer to have the data without the filler.  The video below has more discussion with respect to the technical merits and subjective notes.

## Test Setup Information:

The particular unit I tested is running App Version: 2.8.6.24020217, PCB_version: 5 and uboot_verinfo: 240104.162025.

Testing was conducted using the [Quant Asylum QA402](https://quantasylum.com/products/qa403-audio-analyzer).
* Warmup: Unit was provided pink noise with an output of 1 watt into a 4-ohm load for 10 minutes.
* Test Bandwidth: 22.4kHz (48 kHz Sample Rate) (unless otherwise stated)
* Input to DUT: Phono (RCA).
* Output from DUT: Phono (RCA).
* Volume/Gain: Max.
* DSP Settings: None Unless Otherwise Specified.
* Tests were run at 4 and 8-ohm loads.  Both channels loaded.  However, due to server space costs, results published here are based upon the 4-ohm testing (unless otherwise noted).
* Beyond the static loads mentioned above, *Reactive Loads* were also used for testing and noted.  Both a "simple" and "complex" load. These are designed to emulate a true speaker load without risking damaging a real speaker or deafening myself to test tones from a real speaker.  The impedance sweep of these loads are provided below.

<br>


## Reactive Loads Impedance

## Frequency Response

Response shows some load dependency of the speaker outputs.

Subwoofer Channel Crossover Options (30Hz and 250Hz, min/max, respectively)

<br>
<br>

## THD vs Power

The below graphic shows the THD as output level increases from left to right on the X-axis.  I am showing only one channel here - which is the worst channel - for each load.

<br>


## Power and Subwoofer Voltage Output

The below graphic provides the static load capability at 1% THD and a comparison with the manufacturer's specification in addition to providing subwooffer RCA level output in voltage.

## Power Degradation

The below section pertains to power capability at low volume vs high volume when two test signals are used: a) 1kHz tone and b) Multitone signal.  I have provided 4 ohm only but 8 ohm shows similar results.

In an ideal world the power for the multitone signal is the same as the single 1kHz. Let's verify.

1kHz, low power:

<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/3dpbnz5j0uicqp1pzm6d9/1kHz-4-Ohm-10dBV.png?rlkey=nazpa0hvhl7n2m29fhwhz3ffj&dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />
<br>
<br>

Multitone, low power:

<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/e4lls9wg0sez7dt5v32hw/MTON-4-Ohm-10dBV.png?rlkey=86mkd6wcqfxihq1wqoqrdva7a&dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />
<br>
<br>


1kHz, high power:

<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/6ttcu3540w69r80fmsqzj/1kHz-4-Ohm-Max-Power.png?rlkey=mainf955aimm0sdbj308qx5t3&dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />
<br>
<br>

Multitone, high power:

<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/roizqff69j71vhptjz1ir/MTON-4-ohm-Max-Power.png?rlkey=lt96i8tdiz31d5nzbtganup7e&dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />
<br>
<br>


As we can see from the above, at low power the test signal used doesn't change the output.  However, at high power there is approximately 28 watts of power loss with the multitone signal compared to the single 1kHz signal.

## Parting / Random Thoughts

See video linked above for subjective and objective analysis. A summarized transcript is provided below:

The WiiM Amp is a compact amplifier with great build quality and HDMI input. It allows for easy control through a phone app and has features like EQ and subwoofer output. However, its power output may not be sufficient for larger rooms or speakers with low sensitivity.

Highlights
* Good build quality and HDMI input with Arc capability
* Easy control through a phone app
* Features like EQ and subwoofer output
* Limited power output, may not be sufficient for larger rooms or low sensitivity speakers
* Suitable for smaller rooms or bedroom setups
* Price of $300 makes it a good value for the features it offers
* Stable performance, does not get hot during use
