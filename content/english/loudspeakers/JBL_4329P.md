## Foreword / YouTube Video Review
This pair of speakers was loaned to me by John Schuermann of [The Screening Room](https://www.thescreeningroomav.com/) in Colorado Springs, CO. I was not paid or compensated in any way. Thank you to John for making this review possible.

All my reviews are done on my own time with great care to give you all the best set of data and information I can provide in order to help you make a well-informed purchase decision.  I offer this for free to all who are interested.  In return, if you want to support this site please see the bottom of this review for ways you can help.  It is greatly appreciated.

The review on this website is a brief overview and summary of the objective performance of this speaker.  It is not intended to be a deep dive.  Moreso, this is information for those who prefer "just the facts" and prefer to have the data without the filler.  The video below has more discussion with respect to the technical merits and subjective notes I had during my listening sessions.

## CTA-2034 (SPINORAMA) and Accompanying Data

All data collected using [Klippel's Near-Field Scanner](http://www.klippel.de/products/rd-system/modules/nfs-near-field-scanner.html#:~:text=The%20Near%2DField%20Scanner%203D,move%20during%20the%20scanning%20process.).  The Near-Field-Scanner 3D (NFS) offers a fully automated acoustic measurement of direct sound radiated from the source under test. The radiated sound is determined in any desired distance and angle in the 3D space outside the scanning surface. Directivity, sound power, SPL response and many more key figures are obtained for any kind of loudspeaker and audio system in near field applications (e.g. studio monitors, mobile devices) as well as far field applications (e.g. professional audio systems). Utilizing a minimum of measurement points, a comprehensive data set is generated containing the loudspeaker's high resolution, free field sound radiation in the near and far field.  For a detailed explanation of how the NFS works and the science behind it, please watch the below discussion with designer Christian Bellmann:

CTA-2034 / SPINORAMA:
</summary>
</br>
<p>
The On-axis Frequency Response (0°) is the universal starting point and in many situations it is a fair representation of the first sound to arrive at a listener’s ears.

The Listening Window is a spatial average of the nine amplitude responses in the ±10º vertical and ±30º horizontal angular range. This encompasses those listeners who sit within a typical home theater audience, as well as those who disregard the normal rules when listening alone.

The Early Reflections curve is an estimate of all single-bounce, first-reflections, in a typical listening room.

Sound Power represents all of the sounds arriving at the listening position after any number of reflections from any direction. It is the weighted rms average of all 70 measurements, with individual measurements weighted according to the portion of the spherical surface that they represent.

Sound Power Directivity Index (SPDI): In this standard the SPDI is defined as the difference between the listening window curve and the sound power curve.

Early Reflections Directivity Index (EPDI): is defined as the difference between the listening window curve and the early reflections curve. In small rooms, early reflections figure prominently in what is measured and heard in the room so this curve may provide insights into potential sound quality.

Estimated In-Room Response:
</summary></br>
<p>
In theory, with complete 360-degree anechoic data on a loudspeaker and sufficient acoustical and geometrical data on the listening room and its layout it would be possible to estimate with good precision what would be measured by an omnidirectional microphone located in the listening area of that room. By making some simplifying assumptions about the listening space, the data set described above permits a usefully accurate preview of how a given loudspeaker might perform in a typical domestic listening room. Obviously, there are no guarantees, because individual rooms can be acoustically aberrant. Sometimes rooms are excessively reflective (“live”) as happens in certain hot, humid climates, with certain styles of interior décor and in under-furnished rooms. Sometimes rooms are excessively “dead” as in other styles of décor and in some custom home theaters where acoustical treatment has been used excessively. This form of post processing is offered only as an estimate of what might happen in a domestic living space with carpet on the floor and a “normal” amount of seating, drapes and cabinetry.

For these limited circumstances it has been found that a usefully accurate Predicted In-Room (PIR) amplitude response, also known as a “room curve” is obtained by a weighted average consisting of 12 % listening window, 44 % early reflections and 44 % sound power. At very high frequencies errors can creep in because of excessive absorption, microphone directivity, and room geometry. These discrepancies are not considered to be of great importance.

### Dynamic Range (Instantaneous Compression Test)

The below graphic indicates just how much SPL is lost (compression) or gained (enhancement; usually due to distortion) when the speaker is played at higher output volumes *instantly* via a 2.7 second logarithmic sine sweep *referenced to 76dB at 1 meter*.  The signals are played consecutively *without* any additional stimulus applied.  Then normalized against the 76dB result.

The tests are conducted in this fashion:
1) 76dB at 1 meter (baseline; black)
2) 86dB at 1 meter (red)
3) 96dB at 1 meter (blue)
4) 102dB at 1 meter (purple)

The purpose of this test is to illustrate how much (if at all) the output changes as a speaker's components temperature increases (i.e., voice coils, crossover components) instantaneously.

<br>

<br><br>

### Multitone Distortion

The following tests are conducted at (4) approximate equivalent output volumes: 70/79/87/96dB @ 1 meter.  The (4) voltages listed in the legend result in these SPL values.

The test was conducted in (3) manners:
1) Full bandwidth (20Hz to 20kHz)
2) 80Hz to 20kHz

The reason for the two measurements is to simulate running the speaker full range vs using a high-pass filter at 80Hz. However, note: the 2nd test low frequency limit at 80Hz is a “brick wall” and doesn't quite emulate a standard filter of 12 or 24dB/octave. But… it’s close enough.

## Parting / Random Thoughts

See video linked above for more complete subjective and objective analysis.


The 4329P features various inputs, including USB, optical, Bluetooth, analog, and a 3.5mm jack input. It comes with an 8-inch mid-woofer, ports, a one-inch compression driver, and a JBL high-definition imaging horn design. The 4329P also includes a remote and an Ethernet cable for linking the pair of speakers together. However, it lacks an HDMI input.

Moving on to the pros, the 4329P has a wide frequency range, reaching from 30 Hz to 20 kHz anechoically. In-room performance can extend even lower, down to 20 Hz. The 4329P demonstrates great linearity and excellent directivity. I listened to the 4329Ps in different rooms and found them to sound great in both settings.

Regarding the cons, I wish there were an HDMI input. I also found the supplied ethernet cable for linking the 4329Ps may be too short if speakers are placed more than six feet apart. I would recommend purchasing a longer cable if you plan for your speakers to be further than 6 feet apart.

In terms of sound quality, the I was able to listen to these speakers for extended sessions; as much as an hour at a time and did not experience listener fatigue or boredom.  These speakers are smooth and practically full-range. The bass response is described as awesome, particularly in reproducing strong kick drums. I appreciated the 4329P's ability to reach down to 30 Hz anechoically and 20 Hz in the room.

I tried different angles and found that a range of 0 to 20 degrees off-axis worked well. The 4329P has wide horizontal dispersion, which allows for a good stereo image without sacrificing high-frequency response. The constant directivity through the mid-range and treble frequencies enables flexible positioning.

The estimated in-room response shows good tracking and suggests the ability to tailor the sound to personal preferences by simply towing the speakers in or out.  A trait not shared by non-linear speakers.

Harmonic and multitone distortion measurements indicate low levels of distortion, with some peaking in the 800-1,000 Hz range in the multitone measurements. These distortions may be related to the dips observed in the frequency response.

In conclusion, despite The 4329P's minor non-linearities and compression at highest output volumes, I enjoyed the overall presentation a lot. The deep bass extension, overall linearity, and smooth horizontal directivity are notably positive aspects and let me enjoy my music collection like few speakers do.
