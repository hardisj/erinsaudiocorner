## Foreword / YouTube Video Review

The review on this website is a brief overview and summary of the objective performance of this speaker.  It is not intended to be a deep dive.  Moreso, this is information for those who prefer "just the facts" and prefer to have the data without the filler.  Due to extremely limited time, I am not providing any subjective evaluation but hope the data will be enough for designers and DIY'ers alike that they can glean useful information.

For a primer on what the data means, please watch my series of videos where I provide in-depth discussion and examples of how to read the graphics presented hereon.

## Information and Photos

The [DIY Sound Group Volt-8 v2](https://www.diysoundgroup.com/volt-8-v2.html) is a DIY design from Matt Grant which is available in kit form from DIYSG.  Here are some notes from the product page:
> The Volt-8 uses a custom made 8" coaxial for high output and impressive power handling.  The new surround and spider improves the X-max rating while the light weight cone gives this speaker a smooth sounding midrange even when played at high levels.  The crossover was designed to give an even response that not only excels for surround speaker use, but also for great front speaker performance. The custom compression driver (tweeter) made by Celestion is installed on the back and fires through a small waveguide in the center of the woofer giving you point source sound and great off axis response. I'll be posting more information about the custom driver soon.  It's based off the CDX1-1446.
The crossover was designed to give an even response that not only excels for surround sound speaker use, but also for great front speaker performance. The Volt-8 does quite well in small ported enclosures between .5 and .7cuft when used with a subwoofer. The Atmos version is a small sealed enclosure designed to play down to 100hz, which is great for Atmos use. You can use them mounted in your ceiling without an enclosure for Atmos use if needed.  For surround sound or mains, you should build the ported models.


These speakers were loaned to me by their owner, who built them from the kit.

## CTA-2034 (SPINORAMA) and Accompanying Data

All data collected using [Klippel's Near-Field Scanner](http://www.klippel.de/products/rd-system/modules/nfs-near-field-scanner.html#:~:text=The%20Near%2DField%20Scanner%203D,move%20during%20the%20scanning%20process.).  The Near-Field-Scanner 3D (NFS) offers a fully automated acoustic measurement of direct sound radiated from the source under test. The radiated sound is determined in any desired distance and angle in the 3D space outside the scanning surface. Directivity, sound power, SPL response and many more key figures are obtained for any kind of loudspeaker and audio system in near field applications (e.g. studio monitors, mobile devices) as well as far field applications (e.g. professional audio systems). Utilizing a minimum of measurement points, a comprehensive data set is generated containing the loudspeaker's high resolution, free field sound radiation in the near and far field.  For a detailed explanation of how the NFS works and the science behind it, please watch the below discussion with designer Christian Bellmann:

CTA-2034 / SPINORAMA:
</summary>
</br>
<p>
The On-axis Frequency Response (0°) is the universal starting point and in many situations, it is a fair representation of the first sound to arrive at a listener’s ears.

The Listening Window is a spatial average of the nine amplitude responses in the ±10º vertical and ±30º horizontal angular range. This encompasses those listeners who sit within a typical home theater audience, as well as those who disregard the normal rules when listening alone.

The Early Reflections curve is an estimate of all single-bounce, first-reflections, in a typical listening room.

Sound Power represents all the sounds arriving at the listening position after any number of reflections from any direction. It is the weighted rms average of all 70 measurements, with individual measurements weighted according to the portion of the spherical surface that they represent.

Sound Power Directivity Index (SPDI): In this standard the SPDI is defined as the difference between the listening window curve and the sound power curve.

Early Reflections Directivity Index (EPDI): is defined as the difference between the listening window curve and the early reflections curve. In small rooms, early reflections figure prominently in what is measured and heard in the room so this curve may provide insights into potential sound quality.

Estimated In-Room Response:
</summary></br>
<p>
In theory, with complete 360-degree anechoic data on a loudspeaker and sufficient acoustical and geometrical data on the listening room and its layout it would be possible to estimate with good precision what would be measured by an omnidirectional microphone located in the listening area of that room. By making some simplifying assumptions about the listening space, the data set described above permits a usefully accurate preview of how a given loudspeaker might perform in a typical domestic listening room. Obviously, there are no guarantees because individual rooms can be acoustically aberrant. Sometimes rooms are excessively reflective (“live”) as happens in certain hot, humid climates, with certain styles of interior décor and in under-furnished rooms. Sometimes rooms are excessively “dead” as in other styles of décor and in some custom home theaters where acoustical treatment has been used excessively. This form of post processing is offered only as an estimate of what might happen in a domestic living space with carpet on the floor and a “normal” amount of seating, drapes, and cabinetry.

For these limited circumstances it has been found that a usefully accurate Predicted In-Room (PIR) amplitude response, also known as a “room curve” is obtained by a weighted average consisting of 12 % listening window, 44 % early reflections and 44 % sound power. At very high frequencies errors can creep in because of excessive absorption, microphone directivity, and room geometry. These discrepancies are not considered to be of great importance.

## Additional Measurements
<br>

### Impedance Magnitude and Phase + Equivalent Peak Dissipation Resistance (EPDR)
<br>

For those who do not know what EPDR is (ahem, me until 2020), Keith Howard came up with this metric which he [defined in a 2007 article for Stereophile](https://www.stereophile.com/reference/707heavy/index.html) as:
>... simply the resistive load that would give rise to the same peak device dissipation as the speaker itself.

A note from Dr. Jack Oclee-Brown of Kef (who supplied the formula for calculating EPDR):
<br>
>Just a note of caution that the EPDR derivation is based on a class-B output stage so it's valid for typical class-AB amps but certainly not for class-A and probably has only marginal relevance for class-D amps (would love to hear from a class-D expert on this topic).

<br>


### On-Axis Response Linearity

<br>

### "Globe" Plots

These plots are generated from exporting the Klippel data to text files.  I then process that data with my own MATLAB script to provide what you see.  These are not part of any software packages and are unique to my tests.

<br>


<br><br>

### Dynamic Range (Instantaneous Compression Test)

The below graphic indicates just how much SPL is lost (compression) or gained (enhancement; usually due to distortion) when the speaker is played at higher output volumes *instantly* via a 2.7 second logarithmic sine sweep *referenced to 76dB at 1 meter*.  The signals are played consecutively *without* any additional stimulus applied.  Then normalized against the 76dB result.

The tests are conducted in this fashion:
1) 76dB at 1 meter (baseline; black)
2) 86dB at 1 meter (red)
3) 96dB at 1 meter (blue)
4) 102dB at 1 meter (purple)

The purpose of this test is to illustrate how much (if at all) the output changes as a speaker's components temperature increases (i.e., voice coils, crossover components) instantaneously.

<br>

<br>

### Long Term Compression Tests

The below graphics indicate how much SPL is lost or gained in the long-term as a speaker plays at the same output level for 2 minutes, in intervals.  Each graphic represents a different SPL: 86dB and 96dB both at 1 meter.

The purpose of this test is to illustrate how much (if at all) the output changes as a speaker's components temperature increases (i.e., voice coils, crossover components).

The tests are conducted in this fashion:
1) "Cold" logarithmic sine sweep (no stimulus applied beforehand)
2) Multitone stimulus played at desired SPL/distance for 2 minutes; intended to represent music signal
3) Interim logarithmic sine sweep (no stimulus applied beforehand) (Red in graphic)
4) Multitone stimulus played at desired SPL/distance for 2 minutes; intended to represent music signal
5) Final logarithmic sine sweep (no stimulus applied beforehand) (Blue in graphic)

The red and blue lines represent changes in the output compared to the initial "cold" test.

## Parting / Random Thoughts

* Response linearity is quite varied which indicates a sub-optimal coaxial design.  Similar performance can be seen in the DIYSG Volt-6 I also reviewed ([link](https://www.erinsaudiocorner.com/loudspeakers/diysg_volt6/)).  This is my quote from that review: *The response linearity is pretty poor.  If I am being honest, this just seems like a sub-par coaxial driver with poor tweeter/mid integration.  I say that because the 6kHz region shows some sort of issue where the off-axis response is even higher in SPL than the on-axis response; something I typically see in waveguides and this is way above the crossover point.  There are also pretty significant combing effects above this, especially above 10kHz.*
* Mean SPL is 89.4dB @ 2.83v/1m.
* Impedance sweep indicates enclosure tuning of approximately 65Hz and shows some signs of resonance (source unknown) at approximately 500Hz and again at 700Hz.
* Good distortion performance.
* Poor dynamic range below about 150Hz where both compression and enhancement trade off below 100Hz.
* Good long term compression with practically no change as listening duration continues (though, remember, this is not the same as instantaneous compression (dynamic range), mentioned above).
