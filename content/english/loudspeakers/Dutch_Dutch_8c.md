## Foreword / YouTube Video Review
The review on this website is a brief overview and summary of the objective performance of this speaker.  It is not intended to be a deep dive.  Moreso, this is information for those who prefer "just the facts" and prefer to have the data without the filler.

However, for those who want more - a detailed explanation of the objective performance, and my subjective evaluation (what I heard, what I liked, etc) - please watch the below video where I go more in-depth.

## Information and Photos

<br>

The [Dutch & Dutch 8c](https://dutchdutch.com/8c/) is a departure from the typical bookshelf speaker.  Its cardioid design means it is practically all forward-firing above approximately 100Hz.  This enables the listener to place the speakers very close to a rear wall and get the benefit of boundary reinforcment without the negative characteristic of rear-wall reflections.  It's quite a neat theory that also has remarkable sonic achievements in practice.
