## Foreword / YouTube Video Review
The review on this website is a brief overview and summary of the objective performance of this speaker.  It is not intended to be a deep dive.  Moreso, this is information for those who prefer "just the facts" and prefer to have the data without the filler.

However, for those who want more - a detailed explanation of the objective performance, and my subjective evaluation (what I heard, what I liked, etc) - please watch the below video where I go more in-depth.

## Information and Photos

<br>

The [Dutch & Dutch 8c](https://dutchdutch.com/8c/) is a powered bookshelf speaker that is quite the departure from the typical bookshelf speaker.  Its cardioid design means it is practically all forward-firing above approximately 100Hz.  This enables the listener to place the speakers very close to a rear wall and get the benefit of boundary reinforcment without the negative characteristic of rear-wall reflections.  It's quite a neat theory that also has remarkable sonic achievements in practice.

The front of the speaker features a 1-inch dome tweeter and 8-inch midrange.  The crossover between these two driver units is 1250Hz.  The front baffle is one piece that fits over the drivers, resulting in a very smooth waveguide for the tweeter (notice the lack of screw heads and holes) as well as a smooth lip even on the midrange.

The rear features dual 8-inch subwoofers which play below 100Hz.  The rear also contains the I/O ports (AES digital, as well as balanced analog via XLR) and even a pass through for a separate subwoofer.

This speaker features a built-in amplifier with DSP designed to integrate with Room EQ Wizard for room equalization.  This feature works very well and is very easy to navigate and implement.

I took the liberty of providing a screenshot of the technical specs from the manufacturer's page, provided below:
