## Intro:
A few months ago I came across a forum post that touched on [Buchardt Audio's S400 bookshelf speaker](https://www.buchardtaudio.com/shop/s400-white).  I took a visit to their website to read about it and was (pleasantly) surprised to find the manufacturer provides a set of objective data as well as thorough explanation regarding the design choices.  For example: the discussion regarding the tweeter/waveguide assembly and the benefit of controlled directivity (which is, essentially, maintaining the same response profile as the listener moves off-axis from the intended listening axis; the output decreases but the shape varies little when compared to conventional tweeter designs).  I don't have the funds to make costly purchases for review so I reached out to Mads at Buchardt and inquired about getting a demo pair to try out.  Yes, I know to some that is bothersome as it could imply bias but that's how it is when you're on a budget and no owner is willing to offer their own samples for test.  Mads appreciated that my review goal was objective-data oriented and arranged for me to receive a demo set.

## Foreword: Subjective vs Objective
If you have seen my past reviews you know that I am of the mindset that objective data is at least as important as someone's subjective evaluation of a speaker.  If not more.  Why?  Because every room is different.  Every listener is different.  Some know what to listen for.  Others know what they want to hear based on their own preference (i.e., some prefer extended bass, some prefer more midbass punch between 120-150hz, some prefer a response with a dip around 4kHz, etc, etc).  What one person wants or expects may be opposite of another.  Additionally, the room can have a minimal or a huge impact on the performance and what the listener hears.  Therefore, when you read a subjective review only you are left to contend with those variables.  Hopefully, you can glean enough information from the subjective analysis to provide you with insight in to performance.  Still, without demoing the speakers in your own room you are left to take someone else's word for it.  Unless there is objective data you can use to get an idea of the performance.  However, at the end of the day, it is always best to demo speakers in your own room.  Not simply because of performance; also because of other factors such as aesthetic, pride of ownership, etc.  All these factors play in to how the listener "connects" with the system.

For all of the reasons listed above: What I provide here is objective-heavy analysis.  I still provide my own subjective experience but with in-room measurements at my listening position(s) so we can understand why I heard what I heard.  Is it the room, the actual speaker itself, my brain, or a combination?


Let's get started.

## Product Specs and Photos

I received the pair after a fellow reviewer had his crack and made his YouTube video.  Therefore, as expected, there were some blemishes here and there from previous use.  No big deal there.  One thing I like, aesthetically speaking, is the color.  I like stark contrast in white cabinet vs black speakers.  The speaker itself is also very slim: approximately 7 inches wide.  It houses a small 19mm dome tweeter in a rather large waveguide, a 6-inch aluminum cone mid/woofer and a 5x8-inch passive radiator.  All drive units are made by SB Acoustics, if you're wondering. And, yes, the cone of the mid/woofer is the same as what you've seen in Harman's Revel speakers.

The speakers do come with a black grille for both the mid/woofer and tweeter.  However, I prefer the look of these speakers without the grilles.  And, as you'll see later, the performance is better without the grilles.

## Objective Data

Unless otherwise noted, all of the data below was captured using [Klippel](https://www.klippel.de/) Distortion Analyzer 2 and Klippel modules (TRF, DIS, LPM, ISC to name a few).  Most of the data was exported to a text file and then graphed using my own Matlab scripts in order to present the data in a specific way I prefer.  However, some is given using Klippel's graphing.

<br><br>
### Impedance Phase and Magnitude:

Impedance measurements are provided both at 0.10 volts RMS and 2.83 volts RMS.  The low level voltage version is standard because it ensures the speaker/driver is in linear operating range. The higher voltage is to see what happens when the output voltage is increased to the 2.83vRMS speaker sensitivity test.

<br><br>
### Frequency Response:
<br>
<details>
<summary>Notes about measurements (click for info)</summary><br>

Frequency response data (horizontal, vertical, "Spinorama", polar, spectrograms, etc) are all based on a 2.83 volts RMS logarithmic sweep at 1 meter to meet the standard sensitivity measurement spec.  The measurement axis was between the tweeter and mid/woofer, per the manufacturer's recommendation.  These data are captured using [Klippel's TRF module](https://www.klippel.de/products/rd-system/modules/trf-transfer-function-measurement.html) and a mixture of ground-plane measurement and 4-pi free-field measurement.  [Klippel's In-Situ Room Compensation (ISC) module](http://www.klippel.de/products/rd-system/modules/isc-in-situ-compensation.html) is then used with the ground plane measurement to provide a 'reference' curve to the 4-pi measurement which then corrects for the room's influence and allows me to generate a reflection-free far-field response from an indoors measurement.  Note: This is *not* a standard merge of nearfield and farfield nor a merge of ground-plane and farfield.  Typical merged responses still suffer low resolution in the midrange where the response is merged due to the necessity of windowing the impulse response to remove reflections.  One major downside to "gating" or "windowing" the impulse response is this low-resolution does not show resonance in the midrange.  For example, most free-field measurements are only reflection-free until approximately 3 milliseconds, or about 300hz.  That means a data point every 300hz.  If you have a high-Q resonance at 450hz the 300hz resolution data will not this resonance.  You would need a resolution of at least a half the width of the Q-factor; generally 20hz is adequate.  However, 20hz resolution is roughly 50ms of window-free response.  The only way to achieve this is in a large parking lot or open field.  Ground plane measurements are perfect for this but are subject to aiming/ground absorption (grass) and related issues above 400hz.  The ISC module permits results with as-close-to-anechoic as one can achieve without actually being anechoic.  Thanks to the ISC module, the data I am providing here is higher resolution (~30hz resolution) than an average person can provide without access to an anechoic chamber or the like.
</details>

<br>

Everyone is used to seeing a standard Frequency Response (FR) graphic.  Below are both the horizontal and vertical response over a limited window.  I have provided a "normalized" set of data as well.  The normalization simply means that I took the difference of the on-axis response and compared the other axes' mesaurements to the on-axis response which gives the viewer a good idea of the speaker performance, relative to the on-axis response, as you move off-axis.

<br clear="all" />

I know someone will ask about the apparent resonance around 500hz.  I didn't find this objectionable in my subjective evaluations.  Toole's book covers threshold of audibility with various peaks but I'll reference this article for now:
https://audioxpress.com/article/testing-loudspeakers-which-measurements-matter-part-1

Particularly, this section:
><img align="left" src="/images/Reviews/Loudspeakers/toole_Q.png" alt="toole Q" width="120%"/>
>Figure 4 shows the detection threshold for resonances of various Qs in the presence of typical program music. You see that very narrow resonances (high Q) must be about 10dB above the average level to be heard, whereas very broad resonances need only be 1 to 2dB higher to be detected. This is fortunate because the limited resolution of quasi-anechoic responses may prevent you from seeing high Q peaks, but still allow you to find the lower Q resonances. The best way to identify resonances is via the cumulative spectral decay (CSD) discussed in the next section.

<br clear="all" />

I pulled up my DSP software and put in these settings: Fo=500hz, Gain = + 2.5dB and Q = 15 to match the measured Q.  Meaning, the Q of this peak is ~ 15.  This is very narrow Q.  So, while it looks offensive, it wasn't to me and I believe the above backs up my notion that it wouldn't be to others.  Obviously your mileage may vary.  There are no wiggles in the impedance measurement.  Notably, as you will see in the 360-degree horizontal radiation graphics below, this on-axis peak loses output as you move to the backside of the speaker.  My best guess is this is an influence of the passive radiator experiencing breakup, where on the backside of the speaker the passive radiator has already begun rolling off but on the frontside the pressue level of the mid/woofer combined with the breakup results in a narrow Q boost.

<br clear="all" />

Moving on...

As I said above, the provided frequency response graphs were given with a limited set of data.  I measured the response of the speaker's vertical and horizontal axis in 10-degree steps over 360-degrees.  Nearly 70 measurements in total are represented in my data.  As you can imagine, providing all of those data points in a single FR-type graphic below is a bit overwhelming and confusing for the viewer.  A normalized spectrogram is the better way to view this data.  This takes a 360-degree set of data and collapses it down to a recangular representation of the various angles' SPL.   I have provided two sets of data: one set for horizontal and one for vertical.  Each set consists of 3 graphics:
1) full response (20hz - 20khz with the angles from 0Â° to Â±180Â°)
2) full, "normalized" response (20hz - 20khz with the angles from 0Â° to Â±180Â°) relative to the 0-degree axis
3) the normalized, "zoomed" response (200hz - 20khz with the angles from 0Â° to Â±90Â°) relative to the 0-degree axis

The last two items are given relative to the on-axis response because this makes it easier to see just how well controlled the speaker's directivity is.  Ideally you have a smooth transition between crossovers with no major SPL jumps; this graphic makes directivity changes easier to spot.  The third is provided because the speaker is pretty much omnidirectional below 200hz and there's no real need to see how it behaves off-axis relative to the on-axis response, so I just give you a more zoomed-in view.  :)

<br>

The above spectrograms are kind of the "standard" way of providing directivity graphics.  Most magazines/reviewers provide the response this way.  Some prefer *not* to normalize the data.  Some prefer to normalize the data.  Either way, it's a useful visual to get an idea of the directivity characteristics of a speaker or driver.

That said, a speaker plays in all angles.  Horizontally, vertically and every way in between.  Without thousands of data points and interpolation between them there is no way to visually represent the speaker's soundfield at every point in space. Though, horizontal and vertical axes measurements are enough to provide a good sense of speaker performance.  However, these "collpased" representations of the soundfield are not very intuitively viewed.  At least not to me.  So, I came up with a different way to view the speaker's horizontal and vertical soundfield by providing it across a 360Â° range.  What you see below is just that.  I have provided both an absolute SPL version as well as a normalized version of both the horizontal and vertical soundfields.

Note the legend provided in the top left of each image; this helps you understand which way the speaker would be oriented relative to my provided polar soundfield.

### CEA-2034 (aka: Spinorama):

The following set of data is populated via the 360-degree, 10Â° stepped, "spins" from vertical and horizontal planes. Thus, this is sometimes referred to as "Spinorama" data.  In short, the below takes all the response measurements and applies weighting and averaging to sub-sets and can help provide an (accurate) prediction of the response in a typical room.  Audiholics has a really great writeup on what these data mean ([link here](https://www.audioholics.com/loudspeaker-design/understanding-loudspeaker-measurements)) and there is no sense in me trying to re-invent the wheel so I will reference you to them for discussion.

Furthermore, you can find discussion in Dr. Floyd Toole's book "Sound Reproduction".  [Here's my Amazon affiliate link](https://amzn.to/37tZN0A) if you want to purchase it and help me earn about 2% of the price.

You may ask just how useful the above prediction is.  Well, I'd be remiss for not delving in to that a little bit here.  Please see my Analysis section below for discussion on this.  :)

<br><br>
### Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and Compression:

Distortion and Compression measurements were completed in the nearfield (approximately 0.3 meters).  However, SPL provided is relative to 1 meter distance.

Harmonic Distortion and Compression are provided at varying levels to get an idea of what happens as the voltage in to the speaker is increased and overall output volume increases.  The "mean spl" values associated with each voltage provided in the legend is based on a calculation of expected volume *assuming linear volume* at the 300-3kHz region.  Meaning, if a speaker is ideal and you tell your stereo to increase by 6dB by turning the volume knob +6dB, the output will increase by 6dB.  In the real-world, however, a speaker is a mechanical device and there are compression effects that can limit the output volume and, therefore, you could possibly only get an actual increase in volume of 5dB.  A good speaker will have little compression (< 1dB), where poorer speakers may suffer greater compression (> 2dB).  *Generally speaking*, higher sensitivity speakers (like pro-audio speakers with 100dBSPL @ 2.83v/1m spec) suffer relatively no compression while lower sensitivity speakers (low 80's dBSPL @ 2.83v/1m) suffer more compression.  When a crossover is used the compression near the speaker's Fs is attenuated and overall the compression effects are mitigated.

With that in mind, what you see below is first the Total Harmonic Distortion at varying output levels.  At 2.83vRMS the mean SPL is about 86dB at 1 meter (over 300-3khz).  Distortion at this output is mostly under 0.50% above 200hz and hits the 3% mark at about 80hz.  As you'd expect, the distortion increases as volume increases.  Namely, near the speaker's rolloff point.  If you are in your room and about 3 meters from the speaker and want to listen to these speakers at about 90dB at the listening position then you will need to look at the 93dB (6.02vRMS) measurement.  Why?  The measurements I provide are, again, referenced to 1 meter distance from the speaker and of a single speaker. To get to 3 meters you double the distance twice (6dB*2.  That gets you to 90+12dB for one speaker.  But you'd listen to a pair of speakers in a room which results in +3dB (for doubling of speakers).  Also, typical rooms have a +6dB gain.  So, the math for a pair of speakers in a room at 90dB and 3 meters away breaks down as: 90+12-6-3 = 93dB for the single speaker at 1 meter.  Using the 93dB measurement tells you the measured low-frequency distortion at about 80hz is near 6% THD.  Will you hear that?  Pure distortion is more subjective and depends not just on the listener but also no the program material.  However, in this case, the distortion increase is due to the mechanical limits of the speaker.  And it was audible.  I verified this myself and will discuss it in my analysis section.  But, remember, this speaker test is done without a crossover of any sort.  Once you add a crossover the distortion would naturally decrease.

<br clear="all" />


The compression effects shown in the image below are a visual way of seeing just what happens as the volume is increased.  This one is pretty straight-forward.  Take the legend's SPL value and add or subtract the data from the graphic.  This tells you if you're losing or gaining output (yes, you can gain output from compression; as un-intutive as that seems).  Mostly, the compression results in a loss due to temperature increase in the voice coil of the drive unit.  Let's look at a specific example.  Take the 90dB at 3 meters target listening volume provided above.  Again, you need 93dB's (6.02vRMS) data.  At that volume, the highest amount of compression measured is about 1/10dB.  Nothing, really.  At worst, this speaker experienced about 1dB of output loss at about 60hz with 14vRMS.  The mean SPL of this speaker at 2.83vRMS was 86.5dB.  14vRMS relates to 100dB mean SPL.  So, a gain of about 13.5dB.  This means at 60hz  you actually lose 1dB and therefore wind up with only a 12dB gain over the 2.83vRMS measurement provided at the top of this review.  And at a listening distance of 3 meters that would be about 103dB (or 102dB with this 1dB loss in compression at 60hz).  This is a small bookshelf speaker. I'd say this output level is certainly reasonable.

### Extra Measurements:

These are just some extra sets of measurements I completed.  Some, I didn't process through my Matlab scripts so they're kind of raw.  But I know some would like to see them so here you go.

Grille on vs Grille off.  Moral of this story?  Leave the grille off.  At 90Â° off-axis it looks worse.

<br clear="all" />


Step-Response. Automating this one takes a bit more thought (grab the first return to 0 which in this case is the bass but others would be the tweeter/mid transition swing so would have to add some smarts there... no time right now). So, for now I'm just gonna screen capture Klippel's interface. One not zoomed and one zoomed.

<br clear="all" />

Nearfield measurements.  These are not relative at all.  I just plopped the mic near to the driver/enclosure and swept the signal.  The tweeter SPL is not absolute, nor is mid/woofer or passive radiator.  So, these are not to be used directly against each other.  Don't use this to try to determine crossover frequency.  Just more of a "hmph" bit of information.  Got it?  Good.

<br><br>
## Objective Evaluation:

Now that we have this over-abundance of frequency response data, let's do something different.  Let's compare the data to what the manufacturer says about their own product and see if my objective data backs this up.  Don't worry, we will get to the subjective analysis shortly.

Buchardt's site states:
>"S400 keeps and controls the directivity from 1000 hz and all the way up."  "What this translates to is a non-distorted, evenly distributed in-room frequency response that allows the S400's to sound balanced even at extreme angles, which in turn allows the enthusiast to enjoy sundry benefits like improved imaging, a bigger soundstage, and better transparency. This excellent off-axis response will also result in a drastically widened 'sweet spot' and most importantly, a character that will remain steadfast even as you move around your home as the music plays."

Well, let's see...

The normalized horizontal 360-degree radiation pattern provided above shows that the response between Â±40Â° is pretty even throughout.  This means that what you hear between -40Â° and +40Â° will be roughly the same.  So far, this jives with what the mfg states.  What happens when you actually put the speakers in a room, though?

<img align="left" src="/images/Reviews/Loudspeakers/Buchardt_S400/Buchardt S400_Measured_vs_Predicted.png" alt="measured vs predicted" width="120%"/>

<br clear="all" />

The above is a set of measured in-room response curves from my home theater vs the predicted in-room response curve overlaid on a target curve equaling -1dB/octave from 200hz to 20khz.  What stands out to me is how alike the response of the MLP measurement (single seat) vs the ENTIRE front row measurement is above 1kHz. The two vary by only about 2.5dB from 1-2kHz, less than ~1dB from 2-4kHz and above 5kHz they are practically the same. That's very impressive!  I'd definitely say Buchart's above quote is verified.  Kudos to them!



Another quote from Buchardt's site:
>As an example, larger tweeters tend to be popular because of their power handling and frequency bandwidth, which allows them to be crossed over at lower frequencies. The caveat is that these larger tweeters do not tend to sound as good off-axis and, subjectively speaking, do not sound quite as good (to our ears) as a smaller, well-engineered tweeter. For us, it's all about performance. And when you get right down to it, the 19mm tweeter that we use fits our goals perfectly.

>For one, the measurements are about as ideal as we've found. Secondly, the off-axis performance is tremendous. Any of the limitations that would normally come from using this tweeter has been mitigated by our deep waveguide. The end result is exactly what we were looking for. Top end that's effortlessly free of distortion, resulting in a presentation that's clean, detailed, powerful, and perfectly integrated with the rest of the speaker.

Well, looking at the Total Harmonic Distortion graphs and the already-mentioned front-row measurements I'd say I agree with all of this.  Certainly, when one uses a smaller tweeter the concern with distortion increases (ha!  no pun intended!).  But, as you can see from the THD data I've provided, this is of no concern.  Even at output levels where the speaker's woofer exceed mechanical limits, the tweeter is still strumming away.  Heck, at 100dB @ 1 meter the distortion between 2-3khz (the crossover region) is below 0.50% THD.  They definitely did a good job here.

<br><br>
## Subjective Evaluation:

Before I dive in to using hyperlatives (hyperbole + superlatives) let me first give you the layout of my room...

<img align="left" src="/images/Reviews/Loudspeakers/HT2.png" alt="room layout" width="120%"/>

<img align="left" src="/images/Reviews/Loudspeakers/DSC06104.JPG" alt="room 2" width="120%"/>

<br clear="all" />

Okay, so, the short story of my room is: I don't like seeing speakers when watching a movie.  So I built a false wall and used an acoustically transparent screen with speakers behind it.  The wall is only 2x4's; no panels of wood or anything.  Just a skeleton of a wall to give me something to attach the screen and acoustic treatment to.

Yes.  I like 80's music.

Anyway...

First up, figure out levels.  I used REW to get the volume on my AVR relative to what the actual measured SPL was in the seated position.  I varied it between 85-90dB.  I listened to these before I started measuring objectively and I took notes at the time.  Then I listened again after I completed all the measurements.  The main highlights are the same.  In fact, here's my note sheet:

<img align="left" src="/images/Reviews/Loudspeakers/Buchardt_S400/notes.jpg" alt="demo notes" width="120%"/>

<br clear="all" />

You may notice that I am more descriptive of frequencies than sounds.  Many reviewers will quantify their evaluation discussing how a tone sounded or an instrument sounded.  My history has always been in relating the sounds to frequencies so I can understand where I need to EQ.  So, I'm no good at telling you a cello didn't sound like it should with a certain fellow of a certain weight playing it.  I just go off relative sounds, basically evaluating performance by "How does this frequency sound compared to another".  But, I use this method along with this [Interactive Frqeuency Chart](http://alexiy.nl/eq/) and it works out in the end.

Let's look again at the measured in-room response I provided above:

<img align="left" src="/images/Reviews/Loudspeakers/Buchardt_S400/Buchardt S400_Measured_vs_Predicted.png" alt="measured vs predicted" width="120%"/>

<br clear="all" />

Here's the rundown of my subjective and where it fits with objective, too:
* It is important to note that I demoed these speakers *without a crossover* and *without EQ*.  Just 'raw' performance in my room.  Naturally, the lack of a high-pass filter (HPF) limited the maximum SPL I could achieve and I noticed audibly unloading of the woofer/passive radiator at volumes in the low 90dB range; moreso with the Lauryn Hill and Bruno Mars tracks because they are a bit more stressing on the low end.  When I implemented a HPF = 80hz/24dB the issue was diminished and I could eek out a couple more dB in output.  But, overall, my maximum in-seat SPL was about 95dB @ 11 feet even with the 80hz/24dB crossover.  Per the "6dB/doubling of distance" rule, if you are seated at about 5.5 feet that would increase to 101dB.
* I liked that the John Mellencamp track was wide right as expected but did so without also coming forward of the soundstage which is a positive (some speakers throw the image at an angle forward rather than forward and to the side).
* Female fundamental vocals were nice around 250hz.
* Male fundamentals were a bit thin around 200hz.
* The image was locked in even when moving my head around in the listening position.
* Too much 6-7khz, per my notes.  But, I'd also say that covers the 8khz range.  In other words, the speaker was a bit "hot".  Not terribly so.  Just a few songs accentuated the upper treble range more than I felt it should have been.  The data backs this up as well: look at the 6-8khz region in the Predicted In-Room Response vs Target vs Measured.  It's elevated throughout; extending in to the extreme high frequencies.
* The 2-3khz region was lacking in presence.  Some vocalists (namely, males) sounded a bit "behind" the music.  I don't know if this is due to the lower level in the 200hz region or a combination with this perceived 2-3khz dip.  Apparently I noticed this most on "Head Over Heels" by Tears For Fears.  This could be caused by the directivity mismatch between the mid/woofer and the waveguide (as evidenced in the spectrograms where the response loses output as it transitions from speaker to speaker at the crossover point).
* I wrote that there was good kickdrum in Bombtrack (Rage Against the Machine) but "seems a bit off > 60hz".  This is likely the unloading I was hearing, mentioned in the first bullet above.
* Again, very wide sweet spot in the high frequencies.  I'm very impressed by this.  The room is still your enemy below about 400hz in most rooms so there's not much a speaker of this smaller size can do to help control direcitivity above 1khz (you'd need a *HUGE* waveguide to control directivity down to 400hz.  I know, I have some as part of my theater setup and they only control down to 500hz).


Now, once I ran Dirac Live using the MiniDSP DRC88A I got rid of some of the room modes shown above, having Dirac do no correction above 800hz so I would still get the "speaker response" instead of it being dominated by the room as well..  This helped knocked down the 400hz bump you see above.  I also ran a full-correction from 20-20khz and that smoothed out the 6-8khz issues I mentioned.  Still, without Dirac Live this speaker is quite nice.

The data shows a really good speaker with some frequency response issues that can easily be EQ'd because what you do to one axis is done to all axes; and in this speaker's case the response between Â±40Â° horizontally and about +10Â°/-20Â° vertically are all dead on.  So, as long as you are within this window, you're bound to get similar response anywhere you sit (assuming the room doesn't wreck it).  A few parametric EQ adjustments would make this speaker perform more to my liking, which I verified with Dirac Live.  I like to listen pretty loud and, again, since this is a smaller bookshelf, you are limited in maximum SPL (my own personal evaluation puts that at about 95dB @ 11 feet with varied music; less with hip-hop). A proper crossover and subs will remedy this.  And if you do not listen louder than I do then you'll be fine without a crossover if you're a "purist".


## The End
