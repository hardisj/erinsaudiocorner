## Foreword / YouTube Video Review
The review on this website is a brief overview and summary of the objective performance of this speaker.  It is not intended to be a deep dive.  Moreso, this is information for those who prefer "just the facts" and prefer to have the data without the filler.

However, for those who want more - a detailed explanation of the objective performance, and my subjective evaluation (what I heard, what I liked, etc.) - please watch the below video where I go more in-depth.

Note: Video Coming Soon

## Information and Photos


<br>

The [Kali IN-8v1](https://www.kaliaudio.com/independence#Specs-Section-Independence) is the "second wave" of Kali's IN-8 powered monitor.  Similar in nature to the [Kali IN-5](https://www.erinsaudiocorner.com/loudspeakers/kali_in-5/) I tested, the IN-8v1 is a powered 3-way Studio Monitor featuring a 4-inch coaxial midrange/tweeter however, in this case, features an 8-inch midwoofer in lieu of a 5-inch.  According to the manufacturer, the upgrade from the "first wave" IN-8 are:
>The new 2nd Wave in IN-8 and IN-5 features the latest technology developed by Kali. A new amplifier platform realizes a 12 dB reduction in self noise vs. the original IN-8, lower distortion, higher output, and better reliability.


MSRP for the single speaker is approximately $399 USD and $800 USD for a pair.

With a coaxial (or concentric) drive unit such as the one used in this speaker, the tweeter should be terminated in a way that it meets the midrange cone very smoothly.  The reason for this is because the midrange is the waveguide for the tweeter.  Any discontinuity between the tweeter edge and the inner edge of the midrange creates diffraction.  As you can see in the below photo, the voice coil (or so it appears) protrudes beyond the midrange cone and beyond the tweeter's crossing point with the midrange center.  I measured this to be about 1 mm.  The audible detriment due to this is something I can't speak on.  I can just say it is not "ideal" to have such a discontinuity.  It would take having the ideal profile/termination design measured and listening tests conducted.  The distance from the center of the tweeter to this edge is about 20mm which puts the first reflection at around 8kHz, which also coincides with the on-axis response dip.  This could be coincidence (no pun intended).  I don't want to harp on this too much but I do think this is worth noting.

## CTA-2034 (SPINORAMA) and Accompanying Data

All data collected using [Klippel's Near-Field Scanner](http://www.klippel.de/products/rd-system/modules/nfs-near-field-scanner.html#:~:text=The%20Near%2DField%20Scanner%203D,move%20during%20the%20scanning%20process.).  The Near-Field-Scanner 3D (NFS) offers a fully automated acoustic measurement of direct sound radiated from the source under test. The radiated sound is determined in any desired distance and angle in the 3D space outside the scanning surface. Directivity, sound power, SPL response and many more key figures are obtained for any kind of loudspeaker and audio system in near field applications (e.g. studio monitors, mobile devices) as well as far field applications (e.g. professional audio systems). Utilizing a minimum of measurement points, a comprehensive data set is generated containing the loudspeaker's high resolution, free field sound radiation in the near and far field.  For a detailed explanation of how the NFS works and the science behind it, please watch the below discussion with designer Christian Bellmann:

The reference plane in this test is at the tweeter.  Volume set to '0' with XLR input.  The dip switches were all set to '0' for the free field setting.


Measurements are provided in a format in accordance with the Standard Method of Measurement for In-Home Loudspeakers (ANSI/CTA-2034-A R-2020).  For more information, please see [this](https://shop.cta.tech/products/standard-method-of-measurement-for-in-home-loudspeakers) link.

Note: The roll off rate of this speaker is sharp and therefore some noise was unavoidable at 25Hz which causes a spike in the response here.  Ignore the response below 25Hz.

CTA-2034 / SPINORAMA:

</br>
<p>
The On-axis Frequency Response (0°) is the universal starting point and in many situations it is a fair representation of the first sound to arrive at a listener’s ears.

The Listening Window is a spatial average of the nine amplitude responses in the ±10º vertical and ±30º horizontal angular range. This encompasses those listeners who sit within a typical home theater audience, as well as those who disregard the normal rules when listening alone.

The Early Reflections curve is an estimate of all single-bounce, first-reflections, in a typical listening room.

Sound Power represents all the sounds arriving at the listening position after any number of reflections from any direction. It is the weighted rms average of all 70 measurements, with individual measurements weighted according to the portion of the spherical surface that they represent.

Sound Power Directivity Index (SPDI): In this standard the SPDI is defined as the difference between the listening window curve and the sound power curve.

Early Reflections Directivity Index (EPDI): is defined as the difference between the listening window curve and the early reflections curve. In small rooms, early reflections figure prominently in what is measured and heard in the room so this curve may provide insights into potential sound quality.

Estimated In-Room Response:
</summary></br>
<p>
In theory, with complete 360-degree anechoic data on a loudspeaker and sufficient acoustical and geometrical data on the listening room and its layout it would be possible to estimate with good precision what would be measured by an omnidirectional microphone located in the listening area of that room. By making some simplifying assumptions about the listening space, the data set described above permits a usefully accurate preview of how a given loudspeaker might perform in a typical domestic listening room. Obviously, there are no guarantees because individual rooms can be acoustically aberrant. Sometimes rooms are excessively reflective (“live”) as happens in certain hot, humid climates, with certain styles of interior décor and in under-furnished rooms. Sometimes rooms are excessively “dead” as in other styles of décor and in some custom home theaters where acoustical treatment has been used excessively. This form of post processing is offered only as an estimate of what might happen in a domestic living space with carpet on the floor and a “normal” amount of seating, drapes, and cabinetry.

For these limited circumstances it has been found that a usefully accurate Predicted In-Room (PIR) amplitude response, also known as a “room curve” is obtained by a weighted average consisting of 12 % listening window, 44 % early reflections and 44 % sound power. At very high frequencies errors can creep in because of excessive absorption, microphone directivity, and room geometry. These discrepancies are not considered to be of great importance.

### "Globe" Plots

These plots are generated from exporting the Klippel data to text files.  I then process that data with my own MATLAB script to provide what you see.  These are not part of any software packages and are unique to my tests.

<br>



### Dynamic Range (Instantaneous Compression Test)

The below graphic indicates just how much SPL is lost (compression) or gained (enhancement; usually due to distortion) when the speaker is played at higher output volumes *instantly* via a 2.7 second logarithmic sine sweep *referenced to 76dB at 1 meter*.  The signals are played consecutively *without* any additional stimulus applied.  Then normalized against the 76dB result.

The tests are conducted in this fashion:
1) 76dB at 1 meter (baseline; black)
2) 86dB at 1 meter (red)
3) 96dB at 1 meter (blue)
4) 102dB at 1 meter (purple)

The purpose of this test is to illustrate how much (if at all) the output changes as a speaker's components temperature increases (i.e., voice coils, crossover components) instantaneously.


<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/prvn5tpdub3kafy/Kali%20IN-8v1_Compression.png?dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />

<br>

Based on my results above, it is obvious the output is limited (via internal DSP) somewhere above the 96dB @ 1m output level.

<br><br>

### Long Term Compression Tests

The below graphics indicate how much SPL is lost or gained in the long-term as a speaker plays at the same output level for 2 minutes, in intervals.  Each graphic represents a different SPL: 86dB and 96dB both at 1 meter.

The purpose of this test is to illustrate how much (if at all) the output changes as a speaker's components temperature increases (i.e., voice coils, crossover components).

The tests are conducted in this fashion:
1) "Cold" logarithmic sine sweep (no stimulus applied beforehand)
2) Multitone stimulus played at desired SPL/distance for 2 minutes; intended to represent music signal
3) Interim logarithmic sine sweep (no stimulus applied beforehand) (Red in graphic)
4) Multitone stimulus played at desired SPL/distance for 2 minutes; intended to represent music signal
5) Final logarithmic sine sweep (no stimulus applied beforehand) (Blue in graphic)

The red and blue lines represent changes in the output compared to the initial "cold" test.

<br><br>


### "Midrange as a waveguide" High Frequency Effect
<br>

The following is from my testing of the Kali IN-5 which (presumably) uses the same concentric driver.  At any rate, the purpose/point of this section is the same.  In the photos section I mentioned the purpose of the midrange cone is to act as a waveguide for the tweeter.  I performed [a test in early 2013 with Kef's Q100 Uni-Q drive unit](http://localhost:2897/driveunits/kef-q100-drive-unit/) to see just what kind of (objective) impact the position of the midrange has on the high frequency response. To test this back then I used a 9v battery and connected it to the terminals of the midrange to "fix" the position in and out.  I then measured the response of the tweeter and compared the three positions (in/rest/out).  I have recreated that test here, shown below.  Using a 9v battery again, I connected the leads of the midrange cone (after disassembling the speaker).  The cone's movement was *approximately* ±1 mm.  I have provided a gif below showing the movement range.



<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/0tow730q69rjab1/midrange-excursion.gif?dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />
<br>

As you can see in the below graphic, the position of the cone does influence the high frequency response. Depending on frequency, the effect is as much as 2dB.

<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2cl7j58tcvbhe81/Kali%20IN-8v1%20Midrange%20as%20a%20Waveguide%20Testing.png?dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />

Is this effect audible?  Well, two things in my *personal* opinion:
1) Cone travel speed back and forth is incredibly fast.  Are you really going to hear this "distortion" when you're talking about frequencies above 4kHz?  For point of reference, that's 0.25 milliseconds.
2) You'd have to really be pushing the driver to get it to move this much.  Using calipers, I measured the effective diameter of the midrange to be about 100 mm (3.93 inches) and the area taken up by the tweeter assembly to be around 40 mm (1.57 inches).  Taking the area of the former and subtracting the area of the latter nets me an area of about 10.20 inches² which results in a diameter of 3.60 inches.  Using [this website](http://www.baudline.com/erik/bass/xmaxer.html), I calculate the dBSPL @ 1m of a 3.60 inch cone diameter at 280Hz to be 1mm.  So, assuming all my math and logic is correct, you would have to be playing this speaker at 100dB @ 1m to move the midrange cone 1mm at 280Hz (the crossover point; my target here).  From my compression testing, I already know the output is reduced somewhere in between 96dB and 102dB due to the built-in limiter.  Odds are, then, the midrange is not even moving that much because the output level is limited.

Now, to be fair, this is purely a "fun", "FYI" test and I cannot attest to the audibility of this "high frequency modulation" as it has been termed.  However, from a scientific standpoint, I think it illustrates the purpose of the midrange in such a design.


<br><br>

### Boundary Settings

I tested this with the IN-5 and am providing it again here.  I expect some bit of change from this model but likely not much (and possibly, not at all).
<br>

These speakers come with a set of pre-configured boundary settings that can be enabled easily via the dip switches on the back.  Below is a close shot of the dip switches.

<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/b6hjizb8af8oge6/DSC01213.JPG?dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />
<br>

The dip switch combinations displayed above are labeled and plotted in the graphic below.

## Parting / Random Thoughts

If you want to see the music I use for evaluating speakers subjectively, see [my Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0gBVe7rwdZojX41LakrUUy?si=c3ae973409fa4e66&nd=1).

* Subjective listening was primarily at 1.5 meters but varied from 1 to 3 meters.  Subjective listening was conducted at 80-95dB at this distance.  Higher volumes were done simply to test the output capability in case one wants to try to sit further away.
* The front port means you have more ability to move these speakers in to the prime spot for your needs.  And thanks to the dip switches you have more ability to place the speakers where you need; whether free standing, near a wall or on a console.
* There is zero mechanical noise from these speakers (pops, over-excursion, vent noise) even at higher volumes.  However, these are intended to be used as nearfield monitors in the 1-2 meter range.  Going past this will naturally mean you'll need more volume and if you are listening at absurd levels you will certainly run in to the built-in limiter throttling the output as I showed in my linearity test.
* When listening, I noticed the HF tends to sound brighter the closer I was to the speaker.  In the above in-room measurements you can see there is a gain of about 2dB when moving from 2.5 meters to 1.5  meters listening distance, so keep this in mind.
* Goo Goo Dolls' *Name* sounds a bit sibilant.  Looking at the data, it is likely this is attributed to the peak around 4-5kHz as this stands out by about 2-3dB above the mean in this region.
* Vocals sound a bit too chesty.  Per my listening notes, I ballparked the area to be around 200-300Hz.  The only evidence I can see of this in the data is that the response shows a trough on both sides of 250Hz.  Maybe this is what I was hearing.  Maybe not.
* *December* by Collective Soul has a great drum line and, on these speakers, it sounded quite good.  The bass/midbass is definitely a showcase element of these speakers.
* Hiss: When sitting in the nearfield, approximately 1 meter away, I didn't experience any issues with noise floor in my living room.  The noise is noticeable when within about one foot of the tweeter with the gain (on the speaker itself) at +6dB and also at 0dB.
* Heat.  I recently tested the Focal Twin6 Be and noticed that if the speaker was left on for a while - maybe an hour or so - the amplifier would get quite hot.  Not scalding.  But definitely warm to the touch.  Leaving the IN-8v1 speakers on for hours at a time resulted in no heat at the amp.  Not sure how important this is to you but I thought I'd mention it.
* As for SPL levels, these are marketed as a nearfield speaker.  My data shows the limiter kicking in somewhere above 96dB @ 1m.  I had the output up to about 100dB at 1 meter to stress test with some Linkin Park and there were no mechanical issues that I could hear.  I'd say that you could probably use these in the midfield in the lower 90's pretty well but above that would be pushing it.  Realistically, you shouldn't be mixing music (or listening) above the 85dB range for long periods anyway.  I do not know that I would recommend these for farfield movie-watching but for music at reasonable volumes, you should be fine.

Overall, I really liked these speakers especially for the price.  The large dip on-axis centered around 10kHz concerns me but luckily turning the speaker slightly off-axis remedies this and in a typical room setting, I can't say that listening on-axis is even ideal with these speakers.  I recommend toeing them by about 5-10° either inward or outward, depending on how much sidewall interaction or width you want.  The directivity is quite good until above about 4kHz where the pattern changes and gets a bit wider in radiation before the on-axis dip at 10kHz.

For reference, are these better than the JBL 708P I recently tested?  No.  But the 708p is 4.5x the cost per pair at MSRP (note, though, the 708p does come with a lot of useful features and EQ bands).

Should you get this over the IN-5?  With the increased bass capability and dynamic range at only $100 more, if you have the space, yes.  If not, you're not missing out on a whole lot.

As stated in the Foreword, this written review is purposely a cliff's notes version.  For more details about the performance (objectively and subjectively) please watch the YouTube video.
