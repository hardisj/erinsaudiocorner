# Foreword


The below link provides data using the CEA-2010B metric of defining maximum SPL based on a set of harmonic distortion thresholds.  This standard can be read in more detail here:
https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/cea/cea20102014ansi

In a nutshell, the CEA-2010 metric provides a much better apples-to-apples comparison for subwoofer output capability.  This standard takes a set of tones, broken up in to 1/3rd-Octave steps at frequencies 12.5/16/20/25/31.5/40/60/80/100/120/160 Hz, evaluates the output and corresponding harmonic distortion components and provides a maximum output (Peak SPL) for each tone.  A final "broadband" Peak SPL value is provided based on each frequency's max SPL.

Tests are conducted either outdoors or indoors (in which case, a room correction is applied) with Klippel's Distortion Analyzer 2 employing the use of [Klippel's TRF module](https://www.klippel.de/products/rd-system/modules/trf-transfer-function-measurement.html) for frequency response and group delay and [Klippel's Tone Burst Mesaurement (TBM) module](https://www.klippel.de/products/rd-system/modules/tbm-tone-burst-measurement.html) for CEA-2010 measurements.  The TBM Module provides an automatic tone burst measurement sequence based on Standard ANSI/CEA-2010. Using a fully adjustable tone burst stimulus, the maximum sound pressure level is measured. For a user defined set of frequencies, the measurement is automatically repeated with increased input level. If the distortion in the sound pressure has reached a user defined threshold, the measurement is stopped and the peak SPL is reported. Optionally, a second state signal (displacement, current or voltage) is measured simultaneously.

The Burst measurement module is designed to run band limited burst measurements versus input voltage and frequency. The results are evaluated in the frequency domain towards a threshold curve. For each frequency, the voltage is increased until the threshold curve is reached. The highest voltage not below the threshold curve is used to calculate the peak level of this state signal (according to CEA2010).

Specific steps used to conduct TBM measurements are defined by Klippel in this document [here](https://www.klippel.de/fileadmin/klippel/Bilder/Our_Products/R-D_System/PDF/S44_TBM_Tone_Burst_Measurement.pdf).

# CEA-2010B Test Results (Google Sheet):

**An interactive Google document with tabular results and corresponding graphics can be found here:**

<br>

Measurements are Maximum (Peak) SPL, referenced to 2-meter Ground Plane (2 pi) conditions.

I have purposely chosen to provide the results in the above document because the resolution and interactivity is much better there than it is when provided on this website's page.

Besides the max SPL capabilities, I have included features I feel are important such as:
* Price
* Size
* Crossovers
* Phase (which is a huge benefit if it is variable phase)
* EQ
* Enclosure Loading (sealed, ported)
* Port location

<br>


I have also provided a "Value" column, providing the cost per output (broadband output) as well as size vs output.  These are factors some may weigh heavily.

Feel free to browse around.  Feel free to filter columns to help narrow your list of candidates. For example, if you are on a limited budget, you can use the price column to filter out subwoofers over a dollar amount and then choose the best value.

Donations help me pay for new items to test, hardware to build test rigs (some speakers require different test stands), miscellaneous items and costs of the site's server space and bandwidth.  All of which I otherwise pay out of pocket.  So, if you can help chip in a few bucks, know that it's very much appreciated.
