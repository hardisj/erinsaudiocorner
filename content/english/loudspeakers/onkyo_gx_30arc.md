## CTA-2034 (SPINORAMA) and Accompanying Data

All data collected using [Klippel's Near-Field Scanner](http://www.klippel.de/products/rd-system/modules/nfs-near-field-scanner.html#:~:text=The%20Near%2DField%20Scanner%203D,move%20during%20the%20scanning%20process.).  The Near-Field-Scanner 3D (NFS) offers a fully automated acoustic measurement of direct sound radiated from the source under test. The radiated sound is determined in any desired distance and angle in the 3D space outside the scanning surface. Directivity, sound power, SPL response and many more key figures are obtained for any kind of loudspeaker and audio system in near field applications (e.g. studio monitors, mobile devices) as well as far field applications (e.g. professional audio systems). Utilizing a minimum of measurement points, a comprehensive data set is generated containing the loudspeaker's high resolution, free field sound radiation in the near and far field.  For a detailed explanation of how the NFS works and the science behind it, please watch the below discussion with designer Christian Bellmann:

IMPORTANT SETUP INFO:
This speaker was measured with the reference point between the tweeter and midrange.
Speaker was broken in.
No grille was used.
My testing focused on the default setting. However, I have also provided CEA-2034 "SPINOARAMA" data for this speaker's "DSP Flat" setting.

Measurements are provided in a format in accordance with the Standard Method of Measurement for In-Home Loudspeakers (ANSI/CTA-2034-A R-2020).  For more information, please see [this](https://shop.cta.tech/products/standard-method-of-measurement-for-in-home-loudspeakers) link.

CTA-2034 / SPINORAMA:
</summary>
</br>
<p>
The On-axis Frequency Response (0°) is the universal starting point and in many situations it is a fair representation of the first sound to arrive at a listener’s ears.

The Listening Window is a spatial average of the nine amplitude responses in the ±10º vertical and ±30º horizontal angular range. This encompasses those listeners who sit within a typical home theater audience, as well as those who disregard the normal rules when listening alone.

The Early Reflections curve is an estimate of all single-bounce, first-reflections, in a typical listening room.

Sound Power represents all of the sounds arriving at the listening position after any number of reflections from any direction. It is the weighted rms average of all 70 measurements, with individual measurements weighted according to the portion of the spherical surface that they represent.

Sound Power Directivity Index (SPDI): In this standard the SPDI is defined as the difference between the listening window curve and the sound power curve.

Early Reflections Directivity Index (EPDI): is defined as the difference between the listening window curve and the early reflections curve. In small rooms, early reflections figure prominently in what is measured and heard in the room so this curve may provide insights into potential sound quality.

Estimated In-Room Response:
</summary></br>
<p>
In theory, with complete 360-degree anechoic data on a loudspeaker and sufficient acoustical and geometrical data on the listening room and its layout it would be possible to estimate with good precision what would be measured by an omnidirectional microphone located in the listening area of that room. By making some simplifying assumptions about the listening space, the data set described above permits a usefully accurate preview of how a given loudspeaker might perform in a typical domestic listening room. Obviously, there are no guarantees, because individual rooms can be acoustically aberrant. Sometimes rooms are excessively reflective (“live”) as happens in certain hot, humid climates, with certain styles of interior décor and in under-furnished rooms. Sometimes rooms are excessively “dead” as in other styles of décor and in some custom home theaters where acoustical treatment has been used excessively. This form of post processing is offered only as an estimate of what might happen in a domestic living space with carpet on the floor and a “normal” amount of seating, drapes and cabinetry.

For these limited circumstances it has been found that a usefully accurate Predicted In-Room (PIR) amplitude response, also known as a “room curve” is obtained by a weighted average consisting of 12 % listening window, 44 % early reflections and 44 % sound power. At very high frequencies errors can creep in because of excessive absorption, microphone directivity, and room geometry. These discrepancies are not considered to be of great importance.

### Dynamic Range (Instantaneous Compression Test)

I apologize. I had the incorrect settings for this test and did not realize it until much later; after I had already returned the speakers. However, the multitone compression testing below will give you an idea of the overall output limitations using a longer-term test signal.

<br>

<br><br>

### Multitone Distortion

The following tests are conducted at (4) approximate equivalent output volumes: 70/79/87/96dB @ 1 meter.  The (4) voltages listed in the legend result in these SPL values.  This test signal is dense, similar to pink noise and excites the entire spectrums listed below at the same time.  The test signal lasts 30 seconds.  This is different than the sine wave test signal used to measure frequency response.  The purpose of *this* distortion and compression test is to illustrate how much (if at all) the output changes as a speaker's components temperature increases (i.e., voice coils, crossover components) over time.

Given the test signal is similar to pink noise and exciting the entire spectrum at the same time I also include compression results, which is captured at the same time distortion is captured.  Sometimes these results differ from the compression results you see above (namely with powered designs incorporating DSP-based limiting).

Note: The KLIPPEL software shows compression in the positive scale.

The test was conducted in (3) manners:
1) Full bandwidth (20Hz to 20kHz)
2) 80Hz to 20kHz

The reason for the two measurements is to simulate running the speaker full range vs using a high-pass filter at 80Hz. However, note: the 2nd test low frequency limit at 80Hz is a “brick wall” and doesn't quite emulate a standard filter of 12 or 24dB/octave. But… it’s close enough to illustrate the point.


<br>
<br>

1) Full bandwidth (20Hz to 20kHz)

## Parting / Random Thoughts


<u>Preface:</u>

This speaker offers two DSP settings: "Default" and "Flat." Ironically, neither setting is actually flat. I was so surprised by the measurements and what I heard that I reached out directly to an Onkyo engineer in Japan. I wondered if something was wrong, since at the time of my review and data collection this speaker hadn’t hit primetime yet. Here's the quoted response I received:

> "We have confirmed.
>
> Although we do not know whether the measurement environment was the same, it is true that the Creator Series Flat Sound Mode has non-linear parts in the low and low-mid ranges.
>
> The reasons are as follows:
> We think “flat sound" should not merely mean a frequency response that appears as a straight line in measurements, but rather a natural and well-balanced sound that takes human auditory perception into account.
>
> In reality, human ears have varying sensitivity to different frequencies, and low to mid-low frequencies often sound thinner even when they measure as flat. Additionally, large speakers tend to have their low frequencies reinforced by room acoustics, whereas small speakers inherently produce less low-frequency energy and receive minimal room-based reinforcement. As a result, even if the measured response appears flat, the perceived sound often lacks sufficient low-end presence.
>
> Therefore, our product prioritizes not just measurement data, but also the natural balance in real listening environments. We have carefully tuned the sound to ensure it is perceived as flat and natural to the listener.
>
> There are two important things we want to let you know.
>
> 1. The measured frequency response data may not necessarily match the sound image you actually hear.
>
> 2. We make final adjustments based on the sound that actually comes out in an environment that is close to your usage environment."


<br><br>

I don’t love the result—but at least I can say it’s intentional. Still, I can’t help but ask: why not make the “flat” mode actually flat, and reserve the tonal sculpting for the default setting?

And yes—the bass peak/dip/peak weirdness is real. That’s exactly what I asked about. I’ve never seen a response like that, and I honestly assumed they were correcting bad measurement data with DSP. Apparently not.

<br>

<u>The Sound and Data</u>

The default setting shows us a speaker that needs boundary reinforcement to act as a quasi-baffle step. Otherwise, the 1-2kHz region is quite "forward" and makes instruments jump out (sax and vocals were most noticeable). The 3-7 kHz dip takes a lot of the life out of music and causes it to be unengaging, at least to me.

The flat setting option sounds much better to me, but it still has its faults. The midrange dip causes vocals to sound hollow to me.

Bass isn't deep, but I'm not too bothered by this over a 4" powered speaker. Of course, one could make the argument that many pro-audio speakers use DSP to flatten the bass further down in frequency in exchange for SPL. So, does this Onkyo trade bass extension for higher output? Nope, but let's talk about how I know this...

(I apologize for not having the instantaneous compression data for this speaker. I ran it, but I had the mic plugged into the wrong port and did not realize it until just now when I sat down to look over the results.) However, we can see from the multitone compression the maximum output is limited to about 92-93dB (there is ~ 3.5dB of compression at 96dB). Even with this accounted for, the distortion is very, very high, increasing above -20dB at the 96dB measurement, which is equivalent to over 10% distortion. Therefore, I'd say the more reasonable volume would be around 88-90dB based on the multitone distortion.

<br>

<u>Summary</u>

I was hoping for better, especially from an HDMI-powered speaker. I understand the voicing decisions are intentional—but they’re not choices I would have made.<br>
