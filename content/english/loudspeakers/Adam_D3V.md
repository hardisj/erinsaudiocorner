## Foreword / YouTube Video Review
I was loaned these from the manufacturer to review. I was not paid nor did I receive any other form of compensation for this review. If you are interested in purchasing these, please consider doing so through the below affiliate link:
* [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3GFVrJl)


All my reviews are done on my own time with great care to give you all the best set of data and information I can provide in order to help you make a well-informed purchase decision.  I offer this for free to all who are interested.  In return, if you want to support this site please see the bottom of this review for ways you can support.  It is greatly appreciated.

The review on this website is a brief overview and summary of the objective performance of this speaker.  It is not intended to be a deep dive.  Moreso, this is information for those who prefer "just the facts" and prefer to have the data without the filler.  The video below has more discussion with respect to the technical merits and subjective notes I had during my listening sessions.

## CTA-2034 (SPINORAMA) and Accompanying Data

All data collected using [Klippel's Near-Field Scanner](http://www.klippel.de/products/rd-system/modules/nfs-near-field-scanner.html#:~:text=The%20Near%2DField%20Scanner%203D,move%20during%20the%20scanning%20process.).  The Near-Field-Scanner 3D (NFS) offers a fully automated acoustic measurement of direct sound radiated from the source under test. The radiated sound is determined in any desired distance and angle in the 3D space outside the scanning surface. Directivity, sound power, SPL response and many more key figures are obtained for any kind of loudspeaker and audio system in near field applications (e.g. studio monitors, mobile devices) as well as far field applications (e.g. professional audio systems). Utilizing a minimum of measurement points, a comprehensive data set is generated containing the loudspeaker's high resolution, free field sound radiation in the near and far field.  For a detailed explanation of how the NFS works and the science behind it, please watch the below discussion with designer Christian Bellmann:

IMPORTANT SETUP INFO:

This speaker was measured with the reference point at the tweeter. Input voltage was 0.20 Vrms for SPINORAMA data with the speaker volume set to max.  Tonal options were set to "off" as is the default configuration unless otherwise stated.
Speaker was broken in.

Note: For high output testing please understand this speaker is intended to be used at 0.80 meter distance from the MLP so the testing provided here is certainly higher than the manufacturer ever intended these to be listened to.  But for the sake of consistency with other reviews I am still including this data.


Measurements are provided in a format in accordance with the Standard Method of Measurement for In-Home Loudspeakers (ANSI/CTA-2034-A R-2020).  For more information, please see [this](https://shop.cta.tech/products/standard-method-of-measurement-for-in-home-loudspeakers) link.

CTA-2034 / SPINORAMA:
</summary>
</br>
<p>
The On-axis Frequency Response (0°) is the universal starting point and in many situations it is a fair representation of the first sound to arrive at a listener’s ears.

The Listening Window is a spatial average of the nine amplitude responses in the ±10º vertical and ±30º horizontal angular range. This encompasses those listeners who sit within a typical home theater audience, as well as those who disregard the normal rules when listening alone.

The Early Reflections curve is an estimate of all single-bounce, first-reflections, in a typical listening room.

Sound Power represents all of the sounds arriving at the listening position after any number of reflections from any direction. It is the weighted rms average of all 70 measurements, with individual measurements weighted according to the portion of the spherical surface that they represent.

Sound Power Directivity Index (SPDI): In this standard the SPDI is defined as the difference between the listening window curve and the sound power curve.

Early Reflections Directivity Index (EPDI): is defined as the difference between the listening window curve and the early reflections curve. In small rooms, early reflections figure prominently in what is measured and heard in the room so this curve may provide insights into potential sound quality.

Estimated In-Room Response:
</summary></br>
<p>
In theory, with complete 360-degree anechoic data on a loudspeaker and sufficient acoustical and geometrical data on the listening room and its layout it would be possible to estimate with good precision what would be measured by an omnidirectional microphone located in the listening area of that room. By making some simplifying assumptions about the listening space, the data set described above permits a usefully accurate preview of how a given loudspeaker might perform in a typical domestic listening room. Obviously, there are no guarantees, because individual rooms can be acoustically aberrant. Sometimes rooms are excessively reflective (“live”) as happens in certain hot, humid climates, with certain styles of interior décor and in under-furnished rooms. Sometimes rooms are excessively “dead” as in other styles of décor and in some custom home theaters where acoustical treatment has been used excessively. This form of post processing is offered only as an estimate of what might happen in a domestic living space with carpet on the floor and a “normal” amount of seating, drapes and cabinetry.

For these limited circumstances it has been found that a usefully accurate Predicted In-Room (PIR) amplitude response, also known as a “room curve” is obtained by a weighted average consisting of 12 % listening window, 44 % early reflections and 44 % sound power. At very high frequencies errors can creep in because of excessive absorption, microphone directivity, and room geometry. These discrepancies are not considered to be of great importance.

### Dynamic Range (Instantaneous Compression Test)

The below graphic indicates just how much SPL is lost (compression) or gained (enhancement; usually due to distortion) when the speaker is played at higher output volumes *instantly* via a 2.7 second logarithmic sine sweep *referenced to 76dB at 1 meter*.  The signals are played consecutively *without* any additional stimulus applied.  Then normalized against the 76dB result.

The tests are conducted in this fashion:
1) 76dB at 1 meter (baseline; black)
2) 86dB at 1 meter (red)
3) 96dB at 1 meter (blue)
4) 102dB at 1 meter (purple)

The purpose of this test is to illustrate how much (if at all) the output changes as a speaker's components temperature increases (i.e., voice coils, crossover components) instantaneously.


<img align="left" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/nvn15jbe3sgrgpaijv1c6/ADAM-Audio-D3V_Compression.png?rlkey=pzumqduzomvhto575q387mi71&st=znmvpr89&dl=0" alt="specs" width="100%" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:20px 0px"/><br clear="all" />

<br>

<br><br>

### Multitone Distortion

The following tests are conducted at (4) approximate equivalent output volumes: 70/79/87/96dB @ 1 meter.  The (4) voltages listed in the legend result in these SPL values.  This test signal is dense, similar to pink noise and excites the entire spectrums listed below at the same time.  The test signal lasts 30 seconds.  This is different than the sine wave test signal used to measure frequency response.  The purpose of *this* distortion and compression test is to illustrate how much (if at all) the output changes as a speaker's components temperature increases (i.e., voice coils, crossover components) over time.

Given the test signal is similar to pink noise and exciting the entire spectrum at the same time I also include compression results, which is captured at the same time distortion is captured.  Sometimes these results differ from the compression results you see above (namely with powered designs incorporating DSP-based limiting).

Note: The KLIPPEL software shows compression in the positive scale.

The test was conducted in (3) manners:
1) Full bandwidth (20Hz to 20kHz)
2) 80Hz to 20kHz

The reason for the two measurements is to simulate running the speaker full range vs using a high-pass filter at 80Hz. However, note: the 2nd test low frequency limit at 80Hz is a “brick wall” and doesn't quite emulate a standard filter of 12 or 24dB/octave. But… it’s close enough to illustrate the point.


<br>
<br>

1) Full bandwidth (20Hz to 20kHz)

## Parting / Random Thoughts

See video linked above for subjective and objective analysis. I have provided a brief summary below.

<br>

* **Listening Impressions**
  * Clear and neutral in nearfield setups; distortion rises significantly at higher SPL
  * Noticeable brightness around 4–6 kHz, especially in far-field listening
  * Compact and practical for small desks; strong linearity and control
  * Excellent for tasks like video editing or casual mixing
  * Built-in limiter protects the speaker from overdrive

<br>

* **Data & Measurement Highlights**
  * **Frequency Response:**
    * Flat down to ~50 Hz, then steep rolloff
    * +/-2 dB linearity overall with a mild top-end tilt above 4 kHz
  * **CTA-2034 (Spinorama):**
    * Horizontal directivity ~±60°
    * Slight midrange deviation, broader dispersion around 4 kHz
    * Vertical response narrows quickly; best results on tweeter axis
  * **Estimated In-Room Response:**
    * Brightness becomes more noticeable with increased distance
    * In nearfield, reflections have less impact — response is closer to on-axis
  * **Distortion & Compression:**
    * Distortion low at lower volumes (~76–86 dB), rises sharply above 90 dB
    * Long-term compression ~7 dB at max level (approx. 89 dB SPL)
    * Instantaneous dynamic range shows similar 6–7 dB compression at higher output
  * **Design Considerations:**
    * Internal DSP limits low-frequency output and compresses midrange at high volume
    * Built-in limiter helps maintain safe operation at intended SPL

<br>

* **Comparison to Kali LP-UNF**
  * Both are budget-friendly powered nearfield speakers
  * **Kali LP-UNF:**
    * Larger cabinet, louder (2 dB more output)
    * More bass boost (~2–3 dB), wider horizontal dispersion (~±70°), slightly better vertical forgiveness
    * Slightly higher distortion in midrange
  * **ADAM A3V:**
    * Smaller footprint
    * Better midrange linearity
    * Tighter vertical dispersion, excellent tuning options
    * Slightly lower overall SPL ceiling

<br>

* **Strengths**
  * Excellent nearfield clarity and linearity
  * Built-in room correction settings
  * Compact form factor with passive radiator bass extension
  * Simple setup with only one power cable required

<br>

* **Limitations**
  * Brightness in upper treble region if used far from tweeter axis
  * Steep bass rolloff below 50 Hz
  * SPL/headroom limited to ~89–90 dB max

<br>

* **Recommendation**
  * Highly recommended for nearfield desktop setups, especially for content creators and editors
  * Best when kept within ~1 meter and paired with a subwoofer if deep bass is needed
  * Great alternative to larger nearfields when desk space is limited
