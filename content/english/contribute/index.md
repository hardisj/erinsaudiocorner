# Support / Contribute
<br>

I do not take adspace nor do manufacturers pay me for reviews. All revenue is through YouTube ad-revenue or directly from contributions from viewers such as yourself. While this is not my full-time job it's cool when I'm able to make a few bucks for my efforts.

If you'd like to support the channel I have listed a few ways below. Thank you!

<u>**Patreon:**</u>
<br>Want to be more involved? On Patreon you can vote in polls, see behind-the-scenes stuff, read about the occasional manufacturer drama (fun, right?), and help shape what I do next.
