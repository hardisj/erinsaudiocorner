# Support the Cause

This site is funded with my own money but is improved on with support from the community. I have a full time job and this site is not a means of income for me by any stretch of the imagination. I test and post data in my spare time because audio and science are two passions of mine and this is a great way for me to marry the two.  I share the data with those who share the interest. Unfortunately, it is not cheap to do this kind of thing the right way and it takes time. The test hardware costs money. Test items (drive units, speakers, etc) cost money. Driving around picking up and shipping items costs money.

If you find this site helpful and want to support the cause there are a few ways you can do so below.  Your support helps me pay for new items to test, hardware, miscellaneous items needed for testing and costs of the site's server space and bandwidth.  Any help is *very much* appreciated.

Or using my generic Amazon affiliate banner below to buy *anything* you may need - from toothpaste to Blu-Ray Discs - from Amazon, which helps me gain a small commission at no additional cost to you.  Speaker wire is just the generic link I chose to provide.

Alternatively, if you want to rock a super-cool shirt while helping support the site you can purchase one of my neato shirts through Spreadshirt.  Click the shirt below or [here](https://shop.spreadshirt.com/ErinsAudioCorner) to go to the page.  As an added bonus, if you're wearing this shirt and I see you out I'll teach you the secret handshake (just remind me what it is because I will probably forget it by then).
