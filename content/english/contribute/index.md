This site is funded by my own money and is improved by support from those who can help. I have a full time job and this site is not a means of income for me by any stretch of the imagination. I test and post data in my spare time because audio and science are two passions of mine and this is a great way for me to marry the two.  I share the data with those who share the interest. Unfortunately, it is not cheap to do this kind of thing the right way and it takes time. The test hardware costs money. Test items (drive units, speakers, etc) cost money. Driving around picking up and shipping items costs money.  Just being able to have a few bucks in my paypal account to help offset even my shipping costs is a *big* help. So if you are able to donate anything ... $5 to whatever you feel is reasonable ... know that it is absolutely appreciated and you are doing your part to help me keep this thing moving. So, if you like what you see here and want to support the cause, you can donate directly via the PayPal button below.

Alternatively, if you want to rock a super-cool shirt while helping support the site you can purchase one of my neato shirts through Spreadshirt.  [Just click here](https://shop.spreadshirt.com/erins-audio-corner/men?q=D1) to go to my shop's page.  As an added bonus, if you're wearing this shirt and I see you out I'll teach you the secret handshake (just remind me what it is because I will probably forget it by then).

Every little bit helps and is greatly appreciated.
