Note: While this driver is no longer made, however, to this day I still think it's one of the best pure midbass drivers ever produced. And that's why I'm posting this review.

Up for test is JL Audio‚Äôs ZR800-CW 8‚Ä≥ Midbass.

## Frequency Response

Frequency Response and the following Harmonic Distortion measurements were taken using Dayton‚Äôs OmniMic measurement system.

The frequency response measurements below are on-axis (0 degrees) and off-axis (15, 30, 60 degrees), measured at 2.83v/1m.

## Harmonic Distortion

The following HD graphs are done in the nearfield, emulating the following SPL levels at 1 meter: 90dB, 96dB, and 102dB in order.

## Thoughts

Frequency Response:  Average measured sensitivity in it‚Äôs primary range is approximately 86dB @ 2.83v/1m.  On the low end, the Qts indicates a high value of 1.087 and a Vas of approximately 0.50 cubic feet, which means this driver is likely built for an infinite baffle type install.  According to JL‚Äôs literature, that‚Äôs indeed the case: ‚ÄúThe ZR800-CW is a supremely powerful, dedicated mid-bass driver designed for infinite-baffle or door-mounted custom installations.‚Äù  This driver exhibits fairly linear response up until about 500hz where some issues occur.  Looking at the impedance graph you can see a resonance show up in the 600-700hz region.  This shows up in the FR with the strong dip just around 700hz.  From 700-1200hz there‚Äôs odd behavior, and above 1200hz the response gets better.

Harmonic Distortion:  I‚Äôve provided HD measurements at (3) different SPL levels: 90, 96, and 102dB.  The reason I do this is to see the general trend of how distortion increases with output.  But since this is a midbass and likely will be pushed hard, I‚Äôll evaluate the 102dB level distortion.  The 3% THD mark is hit at just under 40hz.  From 60-300hz, where these are most likely to be used, the distortion level is approximately 0.60%.  At 500hz the THD reaches 1% and rides that range until it begins to fall at ~1200hz.

Bottom line: As a dedicated midbass - in a 3-way type system or a 2-way using a ‚Äòwideband‚Äô driver - this is an excellent choice.  From the data, it is seen you can reach pretty hefty levels with very little distortion (less than 1% THD) crossing this driver between 50/60hz to about 300/400hz.  This coincides with the FR data as well.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend crossing this higher than 500hz, though because the response gets pretty rough above this point and it would be hard to implement a crossover here.  Regarding the low end output, keep in mind cabin gain comes in to play in most cars at about the 60-70hz region and increases the SPL below this point by ~12dB/octave.  Which means some people may be able to run these without a dedicated subwoofer and be plenty happy ‚Ä¶ obviously this is very much user dependent.
