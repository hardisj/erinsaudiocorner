Up for test is the venerable [Scan-Speak Revelator 12M/4631G-00 4.5â€³ Midrange](https://www.madisoundspeakerstore.com/approx-4-midrange/scanspeak-revelator-12m/4631g-4.5-midrange/).
Some refer to this as one of (if not *the*) best pure midrange available.  It is used in many DIY designs as well as manufacturered loudspeakers.
Let's get to it.

## Small Signal Parameters and Impedance

Results as measured via Daytonâ€™s DATs measurement tool.  Which is a very little handy tool to have.  ðŸ˜‰

* f(s)= 84.11 Hz
* R(e)= 3.68 Ohms
* Z(max)= 35.95 Ohms
* Q(ms)= 5.242
* Q(es)= 0.598
* Q(ts)= 0.536
* V(as)= 2.159 liters (0.076 cubic feet)
* L(e)= 0.32 mH
* n(0)= 0.20 %
* SPL= 85.21 1W/1m
* M(ms)= 6.18 grams

## Frequency Response

Frequency Response and the following Harmonic Distortion measurements were taken using Daytonâ€™s OmniMic measurement system.

The frequency response measurements below are on-axis (0 degrees) and off-axis (15, 30, 60 degrees), measured at 2.83v/1m.
* Black = 0 degrees
* Red = 15
* Blue = 30
* Green = 60

## Harmonic Distortion Testing

Legend:
* Maroon â€“ Fundamental
* Blue â€“ THD
* Red â€“ 2nd Order Distortion
* Pink â€“ 3rd Order Distortion
* Green â€“ 4th order
* Teal â€“ 5th order

Testing done in the nearfield to emulate 90dB, 96dB, and 102dB output at 1 meter.

## Impressions/Results

The frequency response linearity is really quite nice, maintaining a fairly flat profile out to 10khz.  The average sensitivity at 2.83v/1m is about 88dB and the response on-axis fluctuates only by about -3dB with no severe cone breakup issues outside the typical passband of beaming (approximately 2khz).  The off-axis response is very nice, maintaining a smooth transition much further than anyone is likely to cross this driver.  At 30 degrees off-axis at 5kHz the output is down about 4dB and at 60 degrees it is down about 12dB.

At 102dB output, distortion reaches 3% THD below ~120hz.  Distortion dips below 1% THD at about 220hz and dips down to 0.50% at about 400hz before a rise in THD begins around 700hz, reaching a maximum THD level of 1.80% at approximately 1.73kHz.
