Up for test is [SB Acousticsâ€™ Satori MW13P-4 5â€³ Midwoofer/midrange](https://www.madisoundspeakerstore.com/approx-5-woofers/satori-mw13p-4-5-egyptian-papyrus-cone-woofer-4-ohm/).  At the time of this updated-posting (02/16/2020) this driver can be purchased from Madisound for about $131/each.  Iâ€™ve got a new install that calls for a 5â€³ midrange and I thought this would be worth a shot.  So, letâ€™s check it out.

Letâ€™s start this out by looking at this work of artâ€¦

## Frequency Response

Frequency Response and the following Harmonic Distortion measurements were taken using Daytonâ€™s OmniMic measurement system.

The frequency response measurements below are on-axis (0 degrees) and off-axis (15, 30, 60 degrees), measured at 2.83v/1m.

Testing done in the nearfield to emulate 90dB, 96dB, and finally 102dB output (in order):

## Wrap-Up

Frequency Response: As you can see above, there is about a 5dB rise in response beginning at about 1.5khz extending through the rest of the response in conjunction with typical modal issues.  Itâ€™s worth noting the ScanSpeak 15m exhibits the same rise, though, a bit earlier in frequency.  You can see the spec sheet here.  Additionally, ScanSpeakâ€™s 15w exhibits very similar FR bump, as seen in the spec sheet here.  Comparing these two, you can see there are actually a lot of similarities in the FR between the Scan 15w and this 5â€³ Satori.  While the FR isnâ€™t ruler flat, this rise occurs at a point where beaming has occurred and therefore most likely would be mitigated by a crossover point that allows a wider dispersion pattern to match up with a tweeter that is â€˜omniâ€™ directional at itâ€™s low end.
The 8khz mode is about 10dB higher than the response at 2khz and shows up off-axis in each increment.  This shouldnâ€™t be a real issue if this driver is crossed over at/before the beaming point, but if you were to try to eek extra performance out of this by crossing close to this point (though, I donâ€™t advise it), either need a notch filter or a very steep crossover slope should be used to avoid the audible sibilance and brightness caused by this issue.

Harmonic Distortion: The HD looks very good if crossed over above 100hz.  At 96dB @ 1m equivalent the THD at 100hz is approximately 1.0%. Above 150hz the THD is less than 0.50% through well in to the high frequency range.
At 102dB @ 1m equivalent the THD at 100hz is approximately 1.4%.  Even at 102dB @ 1m equivalent the THD above 150hz is less than 0.30% for the most part which is still EXTREMELY low distortion for this high of SPL.  The separation between 2nd and 3rd order distortion at this output has about a 15dB delta above 300hz which is very nice.  Overall, some top-shelf distortion values.

Bottom line:
Used as a large midrange crossed above 200hz/LR2 and below 3khz/LR2 Iâ€™d say this is a very nice driver, though you'll need to keep an eye for the shelving in high-frequency.
If you wanted to use this as a midwoofer and cross lower, I'd say 80hz crossover would be feasible in the right enclosure as long as the output volume is kept within reason.  And this drive unit would perform well especially when mated to a larger woofer in a 3-way and crossed above 80hz.
Subjectively speaking, I can say that I used these in my car for about a year and was really impressed with the midrange clarity.  I actually prefered them over the Scan 12m and the Scan 15m/15w as a dedicated midrange â€¦ but Iâ€™m basing these impressions on aural memory which isnâ€™t great, so take that for what itâ€™s worth.

FWIW, you can also find Vance Dickason's writeup on this drive unit in Audio-Express [here](https://audioxpress.com/article/sb-acoustics-satori-mr13p-4-a-new-home-audio-5-25-midrange-driver).
