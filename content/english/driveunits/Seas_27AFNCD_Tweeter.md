Up for test is the [SEAS Prestige H1397 1" Aluminum Dome Tweeter](https://www.madisoundspeakerstore.com/hard-dome-tweeter/seas-prestige-27tafnc/g-h1397-1-aluminum-dome-tweeter/).

A commonly used tweeter in the car audio world and home audio world due to its compact size (outer diameter is only 53mm; approximately 2 inches) and relatively low cost.

## Frequency Response

2.83v/1m, Nearfield and farfield merged at 1300hz.

## Harmonic Distortion

Mic placed in the nearfield and measurements performed at an SPL equal to a farfield level of 90dB/1m.

Output increased to represent 96dB/1m.

## Bottom line:

* Small and very compact.
* $42 price tag (as of this writing) is attractive.
* Measured Sensitivity is ~ 85dB on-axis.
* Very nice off-axis performance, though be mindful of the on-axis rise.  Likely a good candidate if a compact tweeter and 30 degrees off-axis aiming is called for.
* Well controlled high frequency dispersion.
* High THD below 2khz.
* Increasing THD above 5khz at 96dB output relative to 1m.
* Crossed at 2.5 kHz with an electrical LR4, this driver should be able to provide some decent output levels.

<br>
Overall, what I'm seeing here is a very compact, well-performing, low-cost tweeter.
